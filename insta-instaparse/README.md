# insta-instaparse


## Development

Open a terminal and type `lein repl` to start a Clojure REPL
(interactive prompt).

In the REPL, type

```clojure
(run)
(browser-repl)
```

The call to `(run)` starts the Figwheel server at port 3449, which takes care of
live reloading ClojureScript code and CSS. Figwheel's server will also act as
your app server, so requests are correctly forwarded to the http-handler you
define.

Running `(browser-repl)` starts the Weasel REPL server, and drops you into a
ClojureScript REPL. Evaluating expressions here will only work once you've
loaded the page, so the browser can connect to Weasel.

When you see the line `Successfully compiled "resources/public/app.js" in 21.36
seconds.`, you're ready to go. Browse to `http://localhost:3449` and enjoy.

**Attention: It is not needed to run `lein figwheel` separately. Instead we
launch Figwheel directly from the REPL**

## Trying it out

If all is well you now have a browser window saying 'Hello Chestnut',
and a REPL prompt that looks like `cljs.user=>`.

Open `resources/public/css/style.css` and change some styling of the
H1 element. Notice how it's updated instantly in the browser.

Open `src/cljs/insta-instaparse/core.cljs`, and change `dom/h1` to
`dom/h2`. As soon as you save the file, your browser is updated.

In the REPL, type

```
(ns insta-instaparse.core)
(swap! app-state assoc :text "Interactivity FTW")
```

Notice again how the browser updates.

### Lighttable

Lighttable provides a tighter integration for live coding with an inline
browser-tab. Rather than evaluating cljs on the command line with weasel repl,
evaluate code and preview pages inside Lighttable.

Steps: After running `(run)`, open a browser tab in Lighttable. Open a cljs file
from within a project, go to the end of an s-expression and hit Cmd-ENT.
Lighttable will ask you which client to connect. Click 'Connect a client' and
select 'Browser'. Browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449)

View LT's console to see a Chrome js console.

Hereafter, you can save a file and see changes or evaluate cljs code (without saving a file). Note that running a weasel server is not required to evaluate code in Lighttable.

### Emacs/Cider

Start a repl in the context of your project with `M-x cider-jack-in`.

Switch to repl-buffer with `C-c C-z` and start web and figwheel servers with
`(run)`, and weasel server with `(browser-repl`). Load
[http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449) on an external browser, which
connects to weasel, and start evaluating cljs inside Cider.

To run the Clojurescript tests, do

```
lein doo phantom
```

## Deploying to Heroku

This assumes you have a
[Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/dc), have installed the
[Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/), and have done a
`heroku login` before.

``` sh
git init
git add -A
git commit
heroku create
git push heroku master:master
heroku open
```

## Running with Foreman

Heroku uses [Foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/) to run your
app, which uses the `Procfile` in your repository to figure out which
server command to run. Heroku also compiles and runs your code with a
Leiningen "production" profile, instead of "dev". To locally simulate
what Heroku does you can do:

``` sh
lein with-profile -dev,+production uberjar && foreman start
```

Now your app is running at
[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in production mode.
