# TODO
- [x] Audit `/Users/jimmyhmiller/Documents/Code/open-source/git-of-theseus` to catalog features, data outputs, and CLI surface. (done via CLI read-through)
- [ ] Define Rust project structure and CLI UX plan aligned with existing outputs.
- [ ] Port repository analysis engine (`git-of-theseus-analyze`) to Rust, matching JSON outputs against Python oracle.
- [ ] Port plotting commands (`stack-plot`, `line-plot`, `survival-plot`) using Rust-native charting.
- [ ] Build regression tests comparing Rust outputs with the Python reference on sample repos.
- [ ] Polish CLI ergonomics, packaging, and documentation.
