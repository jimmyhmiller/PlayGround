Okay I want to build a lisp. But I want the special forms just to be mlir. Everything else is just macros that expand to it. But I’d love to not have to have a separate interpreter.

Great goal. You can do this with a single, compiler-only pipeline—no separate interpreter—by making “special forms” = MLIR ops and treating everything else as compile-time rewrites.
Shape of the system

Read → syntax objects
S-expr reader that attaches scopes (for hygiene) and carries source ranges.

Macro expansion (no interpreter)
Two macro kinds, both executed inside the compiler:

Declarative (rewrite) macros → compile to MLIR/PDL patterns. Pure syntax→syntax or syntax→IR rewrites; fast and no evaluator needed.

Procedural (builder) macros → compiled on the fly to native code and invoked immediately by the compiler to return new syntax/IR. You JIT these with MLIR’s ExecutionEngine, so you’re still not writing an interpreter; you’re running compiled code in-process.

IR emission
Your “core forms” are just op constructors for existing dialects (func, scf, cf, arith, memref, llvm). After macro expansion, you either have:

direct op forms (your s-expr surface that maps 1:1 to MLIR ops), or

a small amount of sugar the expander resolves to those op forms.

Lower + run
Standard MLIR pass pipeline → LLVM dialect → ExecutionEngine (JIT) or object emission.

Minimal surface that is “just MLIR”
Give yourself an s-expr for op emission that round-trips with MLIR’s textual form:

\`\`\`
wasmCopy code(module
  (func @main (%x : i32) -> i32
    (block
      (%c1 : i32 = arith.constant 1 : i32)
      (%y  : i32 = arith.addi %x, %c1 : i32)
      (func.return %y))))
\`\`\`

Notes:

Every binding is SSA; (block ...) owns region blocks; branches name targets explicitly.

Types are explicit at the sites MLIR expects them (results and some operands).

Then your “language” adds macros like defn, let, if, when, and, etc., that just expand to the above op forms (usually func.func, scf.if, scf.for, cf.br, arith.\*, etc.).
Rewrite macros (no eval at all)
These are hygienic syntax transforms compiled to MLIR’s pattern engine:

You define macro when → (scf.if %cond (then block) (else empty)).

Many Lispy forms (and, or, cond, ->, list comps) can be expressed as local rewrites that don’t need general computation.

Implement them as:

pattern (match your surface syntax) +

builder (emit op-forms).

For bigger sugars (pattern-matching, structs), still doable as rewrites that generate regions/blocks.

Procedural macros (still no interpreter)
For cases where you want real computation at expand time (gensym schemes, compile-time constant folding, DSLs):

Treat macro bodies as phase-1 code.

Pipeline:

Collect macro definitions in a first pass.

Compile them immediately to native via your same MLIR→LLVM JIT (tiny module per macro or one shared).

dlsym/ExecutionEngine lookup, call expand(syntax, api) -> syntax\_or\_ir.

Splice the result back and continue expansion.

This keeps a single implementation (the compiler) and no interpreter. You’re just compiling macro code and running it right away.
Bootstrapping plan

Stage 0: hand-write a tiny set of built-ins in the compiler (Rust) for: module, func, block, SSA binders, constants, scf.if/for/while, func.return, cf.br, call.

Stage 1: implement declarative macros for let, when, and/or, cond, ->, etc.

Stage 2: bring in procedural macros (compiled JIT) for heavier features (pattern-match, type sugar, partial evaluation, derive-like generators).

Stage 3: move most of Stage 0 sugar out into your own macros.

Hygiene & SSA

Use syntax objects with scopes. A gensym() API returns hygienic names that map deterministically to SSA values.

Builder API should allocate blocks/regions for macros; you enforce dominance and argument arity at build time to catch bad macros early.

Example macros (sketch)

\`\`\`
javaCopy code; Declarative rewrite
(macro when (cond . body)
  ;; => (scf.if cond (then body) (else ()))
  (build
    (scf.if cond
      (block (do body))
      (block))))

; Procedural macro (compiled & called)
(macro for (binding seq . body)
  (native-expand (fn [syntax api]
    ;; compute induction var, lengths, emit scf.for with IV symbol
    (emit-scf-for-from api syntax))))
\`\`\`

No-interpreter eval-at-compile-time
If you want constexpr-like evaluation, don’t interpret: lower the tiny “macro program” to LLVM with your pipeline and call it. Cache compiled macro modules by content hash so repeated expansions are instant; invalidate on redefinition.
Pass pipeline (good default)

canonicalize, cse, sccp, inliner

Lower scf→cf, arith/memref→llvm, func→llvm

convert-vector/affine as needed

reconcile-unrealized-casts, symbol-dce

Gotchas

Regions: many sugars want to capture scopes—prefer region-based ops (scf.if/for/while) so macros have a stable target.

Types: MLIR needs explicit types; provide a small type DSL or a type-inference pass before lowering (still inside MLIR if you like).

Errors: attach locations from syntax to every op for great diagnostics.

Phases: segregate macro env from runtime env (Racket-style), even if both are compiled, so define vs define-macro don’t collide.

Tiny Rust skeleton (melior-style, abridged)

\`\`\`rust
rustCopy code// reader -> syntax
fn read(src: &str) -> SyntaxModule { /\* ... \*/ }

// expand -> op-forms
fn expand(module: &SyntaxModule, comp: &mut Compiler) -> OpModule {
    // 1) apply PDL/declarative rewrites
    // 2) compile+invoke any procedural macros via ExecutionEngine
    // 3) result is op-form s-exprs ready to lower
}

// lower & run
fn codegen\_and\_run(ops: OpModule) -> i32 {
    let ctx = melior::Context::new();
    let registry = melior::DialectRegistry::new();
    registry.insert\_all\_known\_dialects();
    ctx.append\_dialect\_registry(&registry);

    let m = build\_mlir\_module(&ctx, ops);     // emit func/scf/arith/etc.
    run\_passes(&ctx, &m);                     // pipeline above
    let engine = melior::ExecutionEngine::new(&m, &[]).unwrap();
    unsafe { engine.invoke("main", &mut []) }.unwrap();
    0
}
\`\`\`

Pragmatic path

Start only with declarative rewrite macros until you hit a real wall. You’ll be surprised how far you can get.

Add “compiled procedural macros” once you need compute at expansion time.

You’ve kept a single code path (the compiler & JIT), so there’s no interpreter to maintain.

If you want, I can spit out a concrete macro definition format and a minimal reader/expander + MLIR emitter skeleton next.

### **ChatGPT**

Okay that’s a nice syntax but I need something simpler to implement. Something where it is immediately clear this is mlir but also is syntactically less complicated. Don’t think of it has human writable necessarily

---

### **ChatGPT**

Here’s a dead-simple, uniform encoding you can implement fast and that still “looks like MLIR”:
The format: uniform 5-tuple
Each operation is exactly:

\`\`\`
php-templateCopy code(op <name> <result-types> <operands> <attrs> <regions>)
\`\`\`

<name>: string like "arith.addi" or "func.func".

<result-types>: vector of MLIR type strings (same text MLIR uses).

<operands>: vector of value refs.

<attrs>: map from string → MLIR attribute text (again, MLIR’s own syntax).

<regions>: vector of regions; a region is a vector of blocks; a block is:

\`\`\`
php-templateCopy code(block <args> <ops>)
\`\`\`

where <args> is a vector of ["%a" "i32"] pairs (arg name + type), and <ops> is a vector of 5-tuples.

Value references

Block args: by name, e.g. "%x".

Op results: by synthetic ids you assign when linearizing a block: "%0", "%1", …
(You allocate them in order as you emit ops; no user naming needed.)

Locations / successors

Put {"loc" "file.mlir:3:5"} in <attrs> if you want; or omit.

For CFG successors (e.g. cf.br), pass block labels in operands as ^entry, ^exit. Blocks can carry an optional label via a "label" attr.

Tiny examples
1) Minimal module: (x + 1)

\`\`\`
perlCopy code(op "module" [] [] {} [
  ; region 0
  [
    (block [] [
      (op "func.func" [] [] {"sym\_name" "\\"main\\"", "function\_type" "(i32) -> i32"} [
        ; func body region 0
        [
          (block [["%x" "i32"]] [
            (op "arith.constant" ["i32"] [] {"value" "1 : i32"} [])
            (op "arith.addi" ["i32"] ["%x" "%0"] {} [])
            (op "func.return" [] ["%1"] {} [])
          ])
        ]
      ])
    ])
  ]
])
\`\`\`

2) If/then sugar target (clearly MLIR: scf.if)

\`\`\`
perlCopy code(op "scf.if" [] ["%cond"] {"result\_types" "[]"} [
  [ (block [] [
      (op "func.call" [] ["@then\_fn"] {"callee" "@then\_fn"} [])
      (op "scf.yield" [] [] {} [])
    ]) ]
  [ (block [] [
      (op "func.call" [] ["@else\_fn"] {"callee" "@else\_fn"} [])
      (op "scf.yield" [] [] {} [])
    ]) ]
])
\`\`\`

3) For loop (single IV, no results)

\`\`\`
perlCopy code(op "scf.for" [] ["%lb" "%ub" "%step"] {} [
  [ (block [["%iv" "index"]] [
      (op "call @body" [] ["%iv"] {"callee" "@body"} [])
      (op "scf.yield" [] [] {} [])
  ]) ]
])
\`\`\`

Why this is easy to implement

Single constructor: Every op hits the same (name, result\_types, operands, attrs, regions) shape. Your builder just:

Parse/validate the 5-tuple.

Create OperationState name.

Convert result\_types via MLIR type parser.

Resolve operands using your %N table (plus block args).

Parse attrs using MLIR’s existing textual parsers.

Recurse into regions/blocks.

No special parser: You reuse MLIR’s own syntax for types/attributes, so you avoid re-implementing printers/parsers for those.

Not human-centric: Numeric %N results keep it trivial; names are only required for block args.

Macro target (your Lisp)
Your Lisp “special forms” just construct these tuples. Example expansions:

(let [x 1] (+ x y)) →
emits the arith.constant, then arith.addi with operands "%x" and "%0".

(if c a b) →
one scf.if op with two region vectors as above.

You can keep macro expansion entirely in compiler code (no interpreter), producing this tuple tree; after that, emission is a pure tree-walk into MLIR.
If you want, I can sketch the minimal emitter interfaces (value table, block stack, and op factory) next.

### **ChatGPT**

Isn’t it two constructs op and block? That’s fine just clarifying.

---

### **ChatGPT**

Yep—just two:

op = (op <name> <result-types> <operands> <attrs> <regions>)

block = (block <args> <ops>)

That’s the whole AST. Everything else is payload on op.
Quick spec:

<name>: e.g. "arith.addi", "func.func".

<result-types>: ["i32" "memref<4xi8>" ...] (MLIR text types).

<operands>: value refs ("%x" for block args, "%0" "%1" for local results).

<attrs>: { "sym\_name" "\\"main\\"" , "value" "1 : i32" , ... } (MLIR text attrs).

<regions>: vector of regions; each region is [(block ...)...].

block <args>: [["%x" "i32"] ...] (arg name + type).

block <ops>: vector of ops; must end with a terminator.

Result ids %0, %1, … are numbered per-block in definition order; multi-result ops take consecutive ids.

CFG targets use block indices in the current region: ^0, ^1, … (or give blocks a "label" attr if you prefer names).

Cross-block values go via block args and …yield/…branch (SSA dominance is enforced by construction).

Module/function/if/for/etc. are just ops with regions.
