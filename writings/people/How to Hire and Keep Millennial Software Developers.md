# How to Hire and Keep Millennial Software Developers

I feel a bit strange writing this article, in all honesty it seems like a waste of time. There are countless articles on how to attract millenials to your company. There are videos of self-proclaimed "experts" on millennials diagnosing the malady that millennials as a generation have, offering their own brand of medicine to fix the situation. Companies convene leadership summits to discuss this issue, often filled with little to no millenial representation. Writing this article feels like merely adding to the noise.

And yet, for my sake and hopefully for the sake of anyone who might read this, I want to get these thoughts out. The discourse on this topic is depressing. Many articles think companies need to merely market better. Others talk of "baby sitting" millenials, of teaching them to act like adults. Most articles paint with a very broad brush, playing off stereotypes and misconceptions amounting to little more than intergenerational disdain.

My hope is to avoid the mistakes I see others making by shifting my focus in two areas. 1) Millenials in all jobs, in all sectors of the market is too broad of a section of people to give any meaningful advice on, instead I will focus specifically on Software Developers, an area I am personally familiar with. 2) Rather than focusing on merely hiring, I want to advise companies on how to hire and *keep* millenials. In order to get millenials in the door, it may be enough to merely change your marketing and hide the truth about your organization during the interview, but in order to keep millenials, you have to do more.

## The Fickle Generation

In order to even have this conversation we have to confront the stereotypes millennials face. Millennials are said to have no loyalty to companies. Companies are continuously told that millennials will leave in a year or two regardless what you do. Millennials can't sit still, they can't commit, they are have to be treated like a "special snowflake" and if they aren't the scurry off to find a place that will. If you believe any of the above it should be no surprise to you that millennials don't stay at your company. Can you imagine having a manger who thought these things of you?

If you are not willing to give up these views about millenials, you shouldn't bother trying to hire them. I will assume though that if you are reading this you don't hold such views. Millennials aren't inheritly less loyal, and yet they do tend to stay at for only a year or two. Why is this? The rest of this essay will explore numerous reasons millennial software developers quit their jobs. Understanding these reasons and controlling for them in your company is key to keeping millennials long term.
