# Don't Write Tests, Generate Them - Elixir 1.7

In this talk we will learn about an exciting new feature (tentatively) scheduled for Elixir 1.7, generative testing. With generative testing, rather than the programmer providing example inputs and outputs (as is the case with unit tests), the program itself generates hundreds or potentially thousands of inputs and runs them through a series of tests. The programmer's job is to provide properties that most hold between the inputs and outputs. This may be as simple as "this function never throws an error" or it may involve complicated business or mathematical logic. 

You will get an early peak into this exciting Elixir 1.7 feature. We will walk through various code samples understanding the parts that power this new testing ability. We will explore a bit of the background of generative testing, where and how has it been utilized by other communities. We peak behind the curtains at how the "magic" works. And finally we will look at potential features that could be implemented to making generative testing more power and user friendly.
