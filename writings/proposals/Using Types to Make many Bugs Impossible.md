# Using Types to Make (many) Bugs Impossible

This talk is aimed at giving a practical introduction to how the proper use of static types can make many bugs impossible. We will look at how types allow us to model our problem, how functional programming helps us think about our problem more directly, and how to apply this thinking to our applications. Our starting point for this talk will be a simple application written in Elm. We will see how to apply these insights about types in a real working application.
