# Practical Functional Refactoring

In this talk we will explore how to take our existing code and refactor it to be more functional. We will examine various techniques applicable to statically typed languages (C#, Java, etc.) as well as those applicable to dynamically typed languages (Javascript, Ruby, Python, etc). This talk will give various examples that have been refactored, but will also give you techniques that you can bring back to your own code.

The first part of the talk will focus on broadly applicable techniques. These techniques do not rely on any special features of any language. We will see how by applying these techniques we are able to make our code more DRY as well as functional. Next we will give some examples of techniques specifically for static languages and in turn those for dynamic languages. We then explore the influence functional programming has had on language development and how the next version of the language you use at work might become more functional. Finally, we will look at how non-functional languages limit our ability to express certain functional features, but how nonetheless we can take inspiration from them.
