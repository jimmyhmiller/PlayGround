# Clojure - A Programming Superpower

In this talk we will look at Clojure, a battle-tested, production ready, stable language that offers programmers an incredibly productive way to code. Clojure has several unique features that allow programmers the ability to solve problems that would be intractable in most languages, succiently and clearly. Not only does Clojure offer features unavailable in any mainstream language, it also works on all the most popular platforms. You can run Clojure on the JVM and the CLR (and seamlessly use all the libraries they have to offer) as well as ClojureScript which compiles to Javascript and can be run on node, the web, and mobile devices.

We will first explore one of Clojure's most important features, truly live programming. Live programming allows us to find bugs and test out new ideas instantly, allow us to write our code faster. We will also see Clojure's support for concurrency, how for example, we can change one character in our programming to make turn it from a single-threaded application to multi-threaded. We will then look at clojure.spec, a validation and parsing library that takes the place of a static type system. We will see how spec not only validates our code, but can generate example data as well as automatically test our code for us. Finally, we will show how any feature of your favorite languages can be quickly ported to Clojure as a library, requiring no change to Clojure itself.
