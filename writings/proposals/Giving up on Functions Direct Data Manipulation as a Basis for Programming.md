# Giving up on Functions: Direct Data Manipulation as a Basis for Programming

Learning functional programming is an incredibly eye opening experience. No longer is our code lost in a sea of loops. No longer is our data scattered, hiding in objects, only accessible obliquely. Instead our code consists of a straight forward pipeline of functions manipulating data. At least this is the story we tell ourselves, but the reality is quite different. Lost in a web of nested pipelines, the shape of our data becomes obscured; our code becomes hard to follow. We wind up, yet again, needing to play computer in our heads.

In this talk we will explore a different model of programming based on direct data manipulation. We will begin by showing how this approach can tackle problems ranging from day to day industry programming to writing a complex compiler. Next we will explore the capabilities this model unlocks when applied at the language level. Finally, we will look further into the future, discussing how we can take this model from dream to reality.
