# Paradigms Without Progress

The computing world has divided itself around the organization principle of paradigms. Borrowing from Thomas Kuhn's notion of a paradigm, Robert Floyd introduced the notion of a programming paradigm in his 1978 Turing Award acceptance speech. Ever since, this notion has infected the software world, becoming an organizing principle for jobs, conferences, and research. But further than that, it has become a ground for interminable debate and disagreement. 

In order to help us understand this unfortunate situation, we will explore Thomas Kuhn's notion of a paradigm. Kuhn's paradigm is much richer than our ordinary everyday understanding; it is not merely a way of approaching problems, but is itself the system in which problems are made intelligible. We will discover the ways in which paradigm is apt for discussing the activities of the software world, and the ways in which our usage of the word deviates from its history. We will then explore these insights showing how they might apply in specific circumstances not typically considered. Finally, we will talk about philosophy's place in computer sciences practice and possible avenues for further exploration.
