Getting out of the Rut - A Dive into Haskell

As professional developers, it is easy to get stuck in a rut. The reality of our jobs force us to use the same technologies over and over again. Often times we find ourselves bored; gone is the challenge that hooked us on programming to begin with. This talk is aimed to confront that boredom, to take us out of our comfort zone, into a language that is vastly different from those we use in our day to day work.

Haskell is a purely functional language. This means there are no loops, no variables, no objects, no side-effects, no mutation. Haskell's approach to programming stands in stark contrast to the predominant paradigms of programming today. Learning Haskell is like learning programming for the first time.

In this talk we will dive into what makes Haskell unique. We will talk about purity, immutability, currying, laziness, and static typing. This will be a whirl wind tour designed not to make you a Haskell expert, but to give you a glimpse of the other side; to show you a side of programming you may never have encountered before. After this tour we will look into Haskells uses in the real world and discuss Haskell's influence on the future of programming.
