Running Programs Backwards: An Introduction to Logic Programming


In this talk we are going to explore a language called mini-kanren. Mini-karen is a logic programming language. This enables it to do things most other languages can't. With logic programming languages rather than telling the computer how to solve a problem, we describe the logical structure of the problem and the computer solves it for us. This is where logic programming gets one of its coolest features, the ability to run programs backwards. By that I mean, we can ask questions like, "if X is my output, what is my input?" If you are interested in exploring new ways of programming you may not have seen before this is a great talk for you to attend.
