# Speech Acts, Elephants, and John McCarthy's Other Language

John McCarthy, the creator of Lisp, also developed another language you've likely never heard of: Elephant 2000. This futuristic programming language is designed around a lesser-known, yet deeply studied aspect of natural language called Speech Acts. In this talk, we'll delve into McCarthy's innovative application of speech acts to transform our concept of programming, unveil the profound underlying connections between speech acts and programming, and contemplate the implications these connections have for how we relate to our programs.

### Reviewer info

I plan to initially focus on introducing speech acts as a linguistic concept and their application in Elephant 2000.

A speech act is an utterance that conveys information while also performing an action. For instance, under the right circumstances, saying "I promise..." not only communicates a promise but also constitutes the act of promising.

Elephant 2000 is a programming language capable of making commitments. It remembers the past (it never forgets) and keeps its word. Its inputs and outputs perform speech acts with real-world effects.

After thoroughly exploring these themes, we will examine how programming itself is a speech act. Drawing from research in software studies and software law, we will discuss the performative aspects of code.

Lastly, we will contemplate the implications. What might a language that adopts McCarthy's approach look like? What other aspects of natural language are our programs missing? How does viewing programming as a speech act alter the way we program?
