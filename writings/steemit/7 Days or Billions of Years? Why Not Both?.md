# 7 Days or Billions of Years? Why Not Both?

There have been several articles going back on fourth on steemit about creation. Most notable [@gavvet's](https://steemit.com/@gavvet) series of articles and [@creatr's](https://steemit.com/@creatr) series of replies. I want to offer a ridiculous, but interesting take on the issue.

Perhaps one of the most fun things about philosophy is reading the seemingly crazy ideas people come up with. This is one of those crazy ideas. This is an idea that might have been thought of in a shower or perhaps when someone was high. And yet, this isn't some throw away idea. It is dreams of a mad man, it is actually serious philosophy. But first the crazy part.

How could the universe, all that we see really have been made both in 7 days and Billions of years? How could both evolution be true and a completely literal reading of Genesis 1? What (to put it as ridiculously as possible), **what if time changed**?

Now I'm sure there is a collective eye roll going on, but hang with me. This idea is comes from Hud Hudson's book [The Fall and Hypertime](https://www.amazon.com/Fall-Hypertime-Hud-Hudson/dp/0198712693). In this book Hudson introduces a number of concepts, most notably, the Growing Block Universe, and Hypertime and then uses these concepts to enter the creationism debate in a interesting way.

## The Real Question

At the center of the debate is the following question, **Is Science Compatible with a Literal Reading of Genesis?** Unfortunately if you take "science" to mean contemporary biological evolution and cosmology everyone pretty much agrees. **No it isn't.** The question then becomes which is right. Young Earth Creationists say the literal reading of Genesis is and that science needs to be fixed. Theistic Evolutionists say that the literal reading of Gensis is not the right read. And (some) Atheists say, who cares about Gensis it is wrong, science has the answers.

What Hud Hudson wants to show is that there actually isn't a conflict here between science and religion. In other words, **All things modern scientists say can be true,and yet Genesis 1 can be read as 7 literal days.** How can that be? Because we've misplaced the debate. The debate is between metaphysics and religion, not science.

### A Philosophical Defense

The key that keeps Hudson from just being a crazy person is the notion of a *philosophical defense*. A defense in philosophy means something that "for all we know" could be true that shows two things are compatible that were thought not to be. In other words, Hudson isn't claiming that Genesis 1 and contemporary science are both true, he is just claiming that there is no contradiction between **Genesis 1 and science, unless modern science entails that hypertime is false.**

## What is Hypertime?

Philosophy of time is an interesting area of philosophy. Is the passage of time an illusion? Do only presently existing things exist or does the past and future exists just as you and I do now? Are people 3 dimensional objects enduring through time or four dimensional "space-time worms" purduring? This are actualy serious questions that people have spilled tons of ink discussing. Hudson here advocates a less common but not unheard of view, the growing block universe 

With the growing block universe, the past exists the present exists, but the future doesn't yet exist. The idea is to imagine the universe as a growing block, the leading edge of this block is the present, as time passes more is added to this block. The block grows and grows, each moment as things which once were in the future become present and then as more is added to the block those moments become past. 

Now imagine that instead of a block that just grows, perhaps it also shrinks. Imagine yourself watching this block. The block sits on a table in front of you. At one point it is  1 foot long, but slowly you watch it grow to 1 foot and 1 inch long. Then a chunk of the block is removed, making it 11 inches, slowly it starts to grow again now to 1 foot and 2 inches. What happened? Well time in that universe has changed.

 Let's imagine that each inch is 100 years and in the chunk that was removed some had invented ice cream. Then that chunk was removed, and unfortunately for all of humanity, the man who invented ice cream wasn't born in this new chunk. So inside this new universe, no one has invented ice cream in the past (though hopefully they will in the future). But yet, from our perspective as observers of the block, someone did invent ice cream, that time was just erased. We can put it this way, **in the past no one invented ice cream, but in the hyper-past someone did**. Think of hypertime as time nested in time.

### What does this have to do with the fall?

Simple, imagine if instead of saying "in the past, God created the universe in 7 days" we replace it with a minor change, "in the hyper-past, God created the universe in 7 days". Perhaps God did create the universe in 7 days. Perhaps the garden did exist, a perfect paradise where no death ever occured, but then Adam and Eve sinned. God as the bible states, cursed the earth. Perhaps this curse was incredibly powerful, rewinding time itself. Or perhaps we've located the curse at the wrong time, maybe God continued until the point of Noah. Perhaps God didn't just flood the world, he distroyed the very timeline Noah had existed in.

If this had indeed happened, God could have created the timeline we see today. The timeline of billions of years, a timeline of evolution, a timeline as modern cosmology describes. All of what science tells us could be true and yet it is true in the hyper-past that God really did create the world in 7 days and he really did flood the whole earth. In fact, any religious claim could be kept this way.

##  Isn't this just unfalsifable nonsense?

In a lot of ways yes. This isn't a thesis that is meant to be taken seriously. No one is meant to believe that God really did do these things, it is completely unmotivated. So what is the point?

People are hasty to declare contradictions where no contradictions have been proven. Perhaps the most famous one is the logical problem of evil. For so long, people held that there was a contradiction between God existing and evil existing. And yet, how exactly these two things were contradicting were never spelled out. Alvin Plantinga came along and pointed this out, but then he went one step further and offered the "Free-will defense", a scenario that should it was indeed possible for God and evil to exist. 

Hudson here is trying to do the same thing. If someone claims,"Science contradicts Genesis 1", they haven't done their full job. How does it contradict it? Hudson claims science can't contradict Genesis 1 unless it entails that hypertime is false. Can science make such a proclamation? No, hypertime is a metaphysical question, not a scientific question. 

**Hypothetical Reply**: But metaphyics (or all of philosophy) is just a bunch of crap.

That's fine, it may well be. But that is a philosophical/metaphysical question its self, not a scientific one. The conflict has been misplaced, it isn't between religion and science, but between religion and metaphyics.

**TL;DR** Science isn't about metaphysics. If hypertime (a metaphysical theory) is true, so can Genesis 1 and modern science. There is no conflict between science and Genesis 1, but there is a conflict between certain metaphysical beliefs and Gensis 1. Hud Hudson watns us to stop conflating the two.


#### Personal views

Please don't take this as an endorcement of Hud Hudsons book. I think it's an interesting idea, but I don't endorse hypertime or its use here as a defense of  young earth creationism.
