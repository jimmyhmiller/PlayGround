# Inventing On Principle

Bret Victor's talk "Inventing on Principle" is perhaps the single most influential talk about the Future of Programming. Of course it must be said that in many ways that is not the subject of his talk but merely a backdrop for his larger project. Yet, its influence cannot be denied. As such, this talk makes an incredibly useful jumping off point for understanding much of the recent work in this field. In this post, I will attempt to summarize not the talk as it is, but the talk as I see it. I will focus on the parts I find most interesting and the parts that others have run with. Bret's work is remarkable in its clarity and breadth. If you have not watched this talk, I recommend going and watching first before diving in.

## The Misunderstanding

While "Inventing on Principle" is certainly influential for what it did say, I think it is also largely misunderstood. Perhaps misunderstood is too strong of word, but I'm not sure the right way to characterize it. Bret's talk captivated those who watched it. His simple presentation style, combined with amazing demos, draws you in. More than that, he makes you feel at each point as if you've reached the climax of the demo, only to undercut you with a "this isn't good enough". In fact, one incredibly fantastic aspect of the recording is that it captured the audience's raw reactions to his incredible demos. And yet I think the impact these demos made on people caused them to miss the point. To understand what I mean, look at how Bret starts his talk.

> This talk is actually about a way of living your life that most people don't talk about. As you approach your career, you'll hear a lot about following your passion, or doing something you love. I'm going to talk about something kind of different. I'm going to talk about following a principle â€” finding a guiding principle for your work, something you believe is important and necessary and right, and using that to guide what you do.

Bret's talk was ultimately not about programming, nor was it about his particular principle. Yet this is the legacy that it has left. The larger point Bret hoped to make seems to have fallen by the wayside. In this essay, we will focus first on the impact that Bret's talk had, ignoring what I take to be its larger aims, then we will come back to this misunderstanding, exploring the oft neglicted half of Bret's talk.

## Inventing on Programming

Bret begins his talk with a picture book of code. On the left, the picture he has been drawing, on the right the code used to produce it. Traditionally these two halves are separated. A change to the code will eventually produce a new image, but only after building and running our code. Instead in Bret's environment, the moment he changes the code, the change is apparent in the image. But as will be a trope of the talk, this isn't good enough. Bret goes beyond descrete changes made by typing, to allowing us to grab and manipulate values with ranges. Allowing us to quickly see how a program responds to a range of values. By doing this, he is able to find a way to make it appear as if the wind is blowing through the trees. A discovery that would have never been made with our current tools. This is a thought we couldn't think.

**(Note to self, should probably add pictures)**

Bret goes on to make more changes to his scene, the instant feedback offering him a quick way to play with his creation. But he then takes further, adding the ability to hover over any code and see what it produced, or hover over a part of the image and see what code is responsible for it. These powers allow us to go beyond authoring to inspecting, allowing someone unfamiliar with the code to immediately make connections to how it works. Bret continues his demo, showing a game with the ability to time travel and see the possible future (perhaps the most influential demo). But he also attempts to show what this process might look like for programming that is non-visual in its output. Here Bret demos binary search, showing the values of each variable as the program progresses, catching bugs as soon as he types them, rather than debugging them later.

### A Flurry of Activity

Bret's talk took the programming world by storm. It showed for the first time in a long time, something that felt radically different. Something that could actually make programmers more productive, something that could make developers much more productive than we currently are. Bret opened our eyes to the fact that we don't have things right and that there are better ways.
