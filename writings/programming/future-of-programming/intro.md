# The Future of Programming

Day to day programming can be monotonous. Programming itself is tedious, the tooling around it cumbersome, the documentation esoteric. The fact that there are so many that enjoy it as a job and hobby (my self included) is incredible given the amount of frustration that it brings. Programming as it stands today is bogged down in historical baggage, its metaphors and organizational principles are borrowed from times whose assumptions no longer hold. And yet at the same time, programming is lost at sea, ignoring the vision for the future that its early pioneers set for it.

The programming world at large sees these facts as largely fixed. This just is what it means to program. Computers are finicky, compricious beasts whose demands must be met. Software is inherently complex. Best practices, discipline, and know-how can take us further than we currently are, but there are no silver-bullets. There is no new technology that will dramatically improve things. In general, we are better off staying with the tried and true methods. Our profession will progress just as long as we properly educate future generations and are ourselves properly diligent.

This serie is about people, projects, and ideas that ignore this view. These undertakings start with different assumptions about what programming means, who should be programming, and how programming should relate to the things around us. These perspectives are not united in any particular creed but in a discontentment with the way things are and a belief that they needn't be this way.

Our path through the future of programming will take the form a highly interconnected graph, no part fully isolated from the other. We will focus on various themes, people, and projects attempting to draw connections between all the various parts. Because of this, things will, of necessity, go unexplained at times. Hopefully to be more fully fleshed out in future explorations.

This post will serve as a non-linear entry point into the material. As I write new posts I will summarize them here, providing, hopefully, enough context for you to choose your own adventure through the material. There will be no priviledged path through the content, no easy introduction. More than anything, this is a personal journey. It is an attempt to find a cause, an attempt to see a better path for an activity that is such a large part of my life.
