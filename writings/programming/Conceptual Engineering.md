# Conceptual Engineering and Programming

At this point it is almost a truism that code isn't written *just* for the computer, it is written for other humans to understand as well. But what does this truism amount to? Typically it means that we ought to leave comments, we ought to name functions well, we should try not to be too clever with our code, and all sorts of other advice people generally give about writing good code. My aim is to show that this sort of advice sells our programs short, it leaves out a crucial function that our code serves and an activitity that we as programmers are constantly engaged in (even if we aren't aware of it). This is the role of Conceptual Engineer.

Conceptual Engineering here is not meant to be synonymous with software engineering. Conceptual Engineering is the process of creating and refining concepts and advocating that others adopt these concepts. Engaging in conceptual engineering is a process of trying to fix language, of trying to provide others with a new way to think about problems. Looking at the history of programming we can see all sorts of examples of conceptual engineering, for example, the creation of OOP. Creating OOP was not about writing some program or other. It was creating a new way of viewing programs. Programs viewed through the OO lense consist of objects that pass messages to one another. Under OOP computation is communication.

But software doesn't have a lock on conceptual engineering, it exists across disciplines. Einstien's redefinition of simultaneity to be perspective relative, Frege's notion of Sense, Raphael Lemkin's coining of the word Genocide. In some of these cases the meanings of old words are modulated to provide new meanings, in others, words are created to capture a particular concept. But all of these cases have something in common, they are attempts to change the way people approach certain questions and problems. Conceptual Engineering attempts to change the meaning of words in certain contexts, sometimes expounding on them, other times changing them entirely, but always with a certain aim in mind.

But clearly the activities we undertake in our day job are not that of creating a new programming paradigm or a new scientific theory. So in what way does the average programmer perform the role of conceptual engineer? My contention is that the whole process of building a code base is the process of conceptual engineering. Building a code base involves the building of a conceptual vocabulary, of explicating the relationships between the various words, and modulating their meanings through the ways in which we employ them. And further, that paying careful attention to this process can lead us to better code, code that does communicate to humans, not because the code employs words in their original meanings, but because by its nature it refines them and argues for this new perspective.

Before we get to how code bases serve this role, let's think about the process of conceptual engineering inside a company. Starting a new job at a new company can be a rather daunting task. When you first start, someone at the company will typically talk to you one on one explaining the landscape. They will define key words and acronyms for you, they will hopefully show you some diagrams of pieces of the architecture. This initial conversation lays some groundwork and helps you get your barrings. But as you have more conversations you find that definition of words you thought you knew doesn't quite match up with usage. What you find is that this business has developed its own conceptual vocabulary. A "user" might mean some particular that is destinct from a "customer". Each domain has its certain terms, but these terms of refined even further within a particular company in order to allow communication to flow.

More often than not it turns out that the vocabulary your company is using is confused. The product people may use a term with a specific meaning on the engineering team to refer to some general concept in the business domain. This can often make communication difficult and error-prone. Changing this fact, getting people to adopt a consistent vocabulary, is itself conceptual engineering and an incredibly important responsibility that engineers have, but sadly this is beyond the scope of this essay. I mention this fact though, because it is an important backdrop to all that we will do. Our work on a code base isn't isolated, it exists in this ever shifting context of the business. If we are to conceptual engineer, we must borrow from this context, as well as improve it.
