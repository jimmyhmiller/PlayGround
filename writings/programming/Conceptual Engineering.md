# Conceptual Engineering and Programming

At this point it is almost a truism that code isn't written *just* for the computer, it is written for other humans to understand as well. But what does this truism amount to? Typically it means that we ought to leave comments, we ought to name functions well, we should try not to be too clever with our code and all sorts of other advice people generally give about writing good code. My aim is to show that this sells our programs short, it leaves out a crucial function that our code serves and an activitity that we as programmers are constantly engaged in (even if we aren't aware of it). This is the role of Conceptual Engineer.

Conceptual Engineering here is not meant to be synonymous with software engineering. Conceptual Engineering is the process of creating and refining concepts and advocating that others adopt these concepts. Engaging in conceptual engineering is a process of trying to fix language, of trying to provide others with a new way to think about problems. The creation of object oriented programming is an excellent example of this activity. Creating OOP was not about writing some program or other. It was creating a new way of viewing programs. Programs viewed through the OO lense consist of objects that pass messages to one another. Under OOP computation is communication.

But software doesn't have a lock on conceptual engineering, it exists across disciplines. Einstien's redefinition of simultaneity to be person relative, Frege's notion of Sense, Raphael Lemkin's coining of the word Genocide. In some of these cases the meaning of old words are modulated to provide new meanings, in others words are created to capture a particular concept. But all of these cases have something in common, they are attempts to change the way people thing and approach certain questions and problems. Conceptual Engineering attempts to change the meaning of words in certain contexts, sometimes expounding on them, other times changing them entirely, but also with a certain aim in mind.

## Engineering a Code Base

But clearly the activities we undertake in our day job are not that of creating a new programming paradigm or a new scientific theory. So in what way does the average programmer perform the role of conceptual engineering? My contention is that the whole process of building a code base is the process of conceptual engineering. Building a code base involves the building of a conceptual vocabulary, of explicating the relationships between the various words, of modulating their meanings through the ways in which we employ them. And further, that paying careful attention to this process can lead us to better code, code that does communicate to humans, not because the code employs words in their original meanings, but because by its nature it refines them and argues for this new perspective.
