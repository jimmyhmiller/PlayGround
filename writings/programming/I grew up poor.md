# I grew up poor

I've thought about writing post forever. But I always stop. Can I really say I grew up poor? Aren't there people in the world who had it much worse than me? Of course, but doesn't negate the fact that I grew up poorer than 99% of the people I work with.

I was never destitute, never lacked basic shelter. But food was hard to come by. One week my only food was a pack of spinkles I found hidden away at the top of our empty pantry. Most weeks my dad gave me $10-$20 a week for food. I was 11 and had to get that food myself. Yes, I had older brother, but I remembered that night when it was snowing, I had no jacket, and he refused to walk with me to the grocery store to buy food.

I remember when I saw kids at school take extra fries. I don't know if they needed them, but I did. And that one time when the lunch lady caught me, and she saw I had free lunch, I could tell she realized repremanding me was a mistake. I remember in 7th grade being asked to make a poster and telling my teacher I had priced out how much it would cost and couldn't afford it. She didn't believe, so to not fail, I used the sharpy I found and the pool sign my brothers friend had stolen as my poster board.

I remember Mr Otterbach, who was notorious for yelling at kids who slept in class, never being mad at me.

## Tech

I remember learning about Maslow's hierarchy and find it to be crap. Code was my refuge. It was food I lacked. During the summer I usually ate every other day. I don't think dad really realized that. He tried his best, but with his quitting alcohol, he was an (self) medicated schziophrenic. The first year we lived with him his overtime helped, but when he lost it, he seemed to have lost the will to try. I'm glad for his manic moments where he bought that Mac mini, even it my brother kicked me off it a bit early.

I'm glad he did. I'm glad that my friend in elementary school had told me about linux. Or else when my brother dragged in the mud soaked computer from beside the dumpster, I would have never had a clue what to do with it. 

## Luck

I got lucky. I never realized that programming was a job. I never knew how much people got paid. I make more in two week than my mom made in a year (I've seen the paid stubs, I'm not exaggerating). Even after high school, I never imagined I could do this for a living. But I'm grateful to Mrs. Johns. Had she not reach out years after I graduated, I don't know what life would even look like now.

## Class

It's been hard being from a lower class. I've had learn that middle class people don't act the same. They hide their emotions. They don't let that frustration show. I remember my dad yelling. My friends parents drunk and upset. I remember the fights. I remember the playground where kids expressed their anger. Emotions all existed to be expressed. But now here. As I would learn much latter, people [don't like you anger](https://jimmyhmiller.github.io/never-change).

## Guilt

I often spend multiple times in a day what I had as a kid for food for a week. Basic things that cost half of what my parents made in a year. I remember my in-laws buying me a pair of Raybans and the guilt I felt for weeks. I felt guilty asking for money, looking for promotions, feeling like a deserved more than what I was paid. But I pushed and pushed regardless.

## Out of place

I'm staunchly in the upper middle class. I make way more than any of my friends I grew up with. I own my home. I save a large portion of my income. Year after year I make more and more money. And yet this sense of unbelonging remains. For a long time I chalked it up to being raised by a schizophrenic parent. That can do a number on you. But more and more I've realized it is my upbringing as someone who was lower class in America. Everytime I meet this people, I can understand them. The middle class people I work with confuse me. I don't know how they do it. How they keep those feelings inside. I've learned to do it in moments. I've learned the patterns that people expect in interviews (though if you caught me on a bad day I bet you saw othewise). I've learned to harness these emotions to the effect people expect. To take advantage of the fact that expressing this frustration, this excitement, this unfiltered emotion is so uncommon at the level I've reached. But I never feel I belong.

I don't think I ever will. Corporate america is place that lower class people are holy unprepared for. I got lucky that I learned programming. My ability to do it well let people give me excuses. But back and tell my earlier self one thing, it would be this quote from C. Wright Mills "White Color".

> When white-collar people get jobs, they sell not only their time and energy but their personalities as well. They sell by the week or month their smiles and their kindly gestures, and they must practice the prompt repression of resentment and aggression. For these intimate traits are of commercial relevance.

If you are like me. Learn this lesson well. Realize, this is what your selling, and ask yourself, how often do you want to sell it?
