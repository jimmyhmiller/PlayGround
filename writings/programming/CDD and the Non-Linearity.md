# CDD and the Non-Linearity of Discovery

I have written previously about how Card Driven Development is extremely detrimental to the development process. In that essay I pegged the problem on CDDs lack of proper knowledge sharing and its incorrect splitting of responsibility. Today I want to focus on a different attribute of CDD that has been bothering me lately. This is the start of me trying to deliver on the promissory note I left at the end of the last essay. If we are to replace CDD we must start with an understanding of what programming is. That is our starting point today. Programming is theory building, does CDD help us build theories?

Perhaps my last essay could be seen as a bit of a characture. I don’t think it is, I have in fact seen this process play out in practice. But let’s assume I am wrong. Maybe CDD isn’t disasterous. Maybe I gave too much credit to a process for creating such turmoil. What then would the problem with CDD be? If you don’t see the social problems on CDD that I do why should you not use it?

## Theory Building an Linearity

Theory Building is an activity of trying to take information about the world and it put it to some particular use. Sherlock Holmes works to build his theories in order to apprehend criminals. Someone decorating a home builds their theory so that they might make their home cozy, habitable, and enjoyable to live in. A software engineer builds their theory to enable them to solve the problems at hand, not only the problems of today, but the problems that will arise tomorrow.

Consider instance of complex theory building, how do it proceed? Does Sherlock Holmes proceed from clue to clue, following a linear path to apprehension of the criminal? No the investigation is full of false starts, of reimaginings, of unexpected twists. But most importantly is Holmes thoughts on the matter. Holmes theory involves learning lessons and responding to them in unusual, particular ways. The process of learning and responding is important to his investigation. If Holmes merely gathered the data, brought it to the police and let them decide his next steps, would he have been as effective?

The same is true for all theoretical investigations. These investigations give us embodied knowledge. The fact that *we* worked out the theory is an important aspect of its creation. We had to go through this process of discover, we had to have the false starts, without them we would not have created the same theory.
