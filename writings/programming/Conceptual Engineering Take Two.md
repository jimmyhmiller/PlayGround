# Conceputal Engineering

Naming things is one of the most difficult task in all of software. This fact is generally agreed by all parties and yet exactly why it is so hard is never explored. If we explore this issue at all, it is at the very surface level. Perhaps names are hard to choose because others have already used them, or maybe the names we choose might be offensive in another language or context, or maybe we lose nuance and risk confusing two actually distinct concepts. These are all true things about what makes naming difficult. But to stop here ignores the true complexity of naming and also ignores a responsibility that we as software engineers have. When we name things we aren't merely placing a label on something, we are creating and refining concepts, and asserting that others ought to adopt our concepts. We are in the process of conceptual engineering, a process that if it is to be successful does not end once the name has been chosen.

This may seem overly grandiose, don't we just mean that picking a name is hard? Isn't that why we often end up with things like single letter variables or `temp12`. This is certainly true, but when we think about the systems we build we can see the dfficulty in naming stretches far beyond these local circumstances. How many times do you have to explain to a new developer that term A is used in system 1 to mean X, but is used in system 2 to mean Y? Or that actually even just in system 1 X can mean three different thing? Or perhaps you have to explain an out of date term, one that reigned for sometime as the dominant name for something but was ultimately replaced but a newer, "better" term. In what sense is this term better? These sorts of matters hopefully show that the difficulty in the naming process isn't just in the dubbing of a concept, it is in the words continual use and lifetime.
