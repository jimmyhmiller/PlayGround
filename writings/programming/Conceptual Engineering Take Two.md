# Conceputal Engineering

Naming things is one of the most difficult task in all of software. This fact is generally agreed by all parties and yet exactly why it is so hard is never explored. If we explore this issue at all, it is at the very surface level. Perhaps names are hard to choose because others have already used them, or maybe the names we choose might be offensive in another language or context, or maybe we lose nuance and risk confusing two actually distinct concepts. These are all true things about what makes naming difficult. But to stop here ignores the true complexity of naming and also ignores a responsibility that we as software engineers have. When we name things we aren't merely placing a label on something, we are creating and refining concepts, and asserting that others ought to adopt our concepts. We are in the process of conceptual engineering, a process that if it is to be successful does not end once the name has been chosen.

This may seem overly grandiose, don't we just mean that picking a name is hard? Isn't that why we often end up with things like single letter variables or `temp12`? This is certainly true, but when we think about the systems we build we can see the dfficulty in naming stretches far beyond these local circumstances. How many times do you have to explain to a new developer that term A is used in system 1 to mean X, but is used in system 2 to mean Y? Or that actually even just in system 1 X can mean three different thing? Or perhaps you have to explain an out of date term, one that reigned for sometime as the dominant name for something but was ultimately replaced but a newer, "better" term. In what sense is this term better? These sorts of matters hopefully show that the difficulty in the naming process isn't just in the dubbing of a concept, it is in the word's continual use and lifetime.

The names we choose how long term consequences. They serve not just as identifiers in the body of a program, but the form the concepts by which others will think about our code. The process of naming does not end with its dubbing, it is a process called "Conceptual Engineering". When we chose names in our programs we are taking a word, refining it to have a particular meaning, and encouraging others to take up our meaning. Whether by our intention or not, the words we choose and the way in which we employ them will deeply affect the way others interact with our programs and our business domain. We must not only choose the words, but convince others to take up our usage, teach others our meanings, and continue to refine these meanings as contexts change. Failure to do any of these elements can lead to a failure in naming.
