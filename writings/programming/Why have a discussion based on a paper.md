# Why have a discussion based on a paper

When I joined the future of coding, we switched from interviews to discussions based on papers. I pitched Ivan on the concept and he went along with it. Well, initially I thought I was just pitching a single episode, but he was kind enough to offer me a spot as permanent cohost. 

Not everyone is a fan of paper format. I don't blame them. Papers can be boring, especially computer science papers. I haven't enjoyed every paper we've read. Some have been overly verbose. Some have made incredibly bad arguments. Some have been so vague, it is unclear what they really want to claim. But I think even these papers serve an important function in our conversation. This is my attempt to both defend the reading of papers and to explain the way I view the role the paper plays in our conversation.

## Stuck Thoughts

It's really easy to be stuck in your own thoughts. By that I don't mean day dreaming or obsessing over something, but rather that you find yourself believing something so strongly, it is hard to think otherwise. I grew up this way surrounded by people who reinforced this habit in me. Some part of that was certainly my religious upbringing, but I can't say it was exclusively that. I was taught all sorts of things about the world, about people, that felt true to me. Or at least, I had no reason to doubt them.

But something changed as I got older. Growing up I never had much interest in reading. Sure I devoured the Harry Potter series and enjoyed Hatchet in 5th grade. But that was about it. But at some point my questions were simply not being answered and I turned to the place I was told they could be, books. I remember one of those recommended books: "Fatal Flaws: What Evolutionists Don't Want You to Know". (A book arguing for young earth creationism.)  I can't say I'd recommend anyone read it. And looking back I'm embarrased to say I accepted it. But in many ways I owe this awful book for making me interested in reading more.

I actually can't remember exactly what I read that made me start questioning those beliefs. But I know when I started reading evolution texts written by people who really understood the topic, I started to see just how wrong Fatal Flaws had been. Reading it years later, the rhetoric was clear, the arguments were flimsy. But, what Fatal Flaws had done for me, was to make precise what had only been a passed down belief before. After Fatal Flaws, I wasn't just a generic young earth creationist, I had reasons for being so! And it was those reasons that helped me get unstuck.

## Being Explicit

Because Fatal Flaws turned my indoctrinated belief from vague ideas into explicit statements of "facts", I was able to be convinced that I was wrong. I believe that for many of us, when it comes to programming beliefs, we are stuck in the state I once was with respect evolution before I read Fatal Flaws. Not that we believe some nonsense like creationism. But that our beliefs are held for implicit, rather than explicit reasons. That if we happen to have good, true, belief, we have it by accident. Beliefs that form in this implicit manner are hard to shake.

What is at the root of the disagreement around static and dynamic types? Why do some people deeply believe in the 10x programmer and others deeply believe they don't exist? Why does the idea of visual programming cause some many disgust while others delight? There are countless beliefs from which we cannot move until we make our beliefs explicit.

I believe this is the fundamental role the paper plays in our discussion. The paper is the artifact, that by its objective nature, let's us be explicit. When you have a freeform discussion (especially with three or more people), it is very easy to stay with generalizations. Being vague is a wonderful defense mechanism. It is hard to be wrong when you are vague. It is easy to defend your position when you don't need to state it clearly. The paper is the means by which we break these tendencies.

Now, I don't mean that the paper is somehow less bias than we are. That somehow papers carve the world at their joints in a better way than we can. I mean that the paper itself, is a real artifact in the world which we now have shared access to. When a discussion is grounded in a paper, there is always a base to return to. Discussing what the paper said, what it meant, are all things we can decide with mutually shared evidence. When wanting to make a claim about what the paper says, I don't simply go with my gut, I find the quote and read it.
