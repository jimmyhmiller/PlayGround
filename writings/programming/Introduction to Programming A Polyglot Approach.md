# Introduction to Programming: A Polyglot Approach

Nearly every "Introduction to Programming" book picks a single language to use throughout. In fact, it seems not so much a deliberate choice, but more as an assumption about what consititutes an introductory text. Throwing too many different things at a beginner can often confuse them; it can lead to too many errors. Perhaps these authors are right, perhaps a single language is best, but our hope for this book, is that they are indeed wrong. 

It is our contention that confining a beginner to one language robs them first of the beauty and variety the programming world offers, and secondly risks biasing their formative thoughts, preventing them from learning and enjoying a different approach to programming than the one they were first taught. Programming lives above any particular paradigm the partisans of the programming world peddle as *THE RIGHT WAY*. But far from proclaiming all paradigms equal, this book hopes to present the reader with many distict styles, showing both their strengths and weaknesses.

This endevor cannot help but create its own bias. The choice of languages in this book is itself a form of bias, as is the order and manner in which they are presented. Ridding this work of bias is not the goal, but rather to help the reader form their own bias, by allowing the reader the opportunity to think in different ways, to test different theories, and to be pushed intellectually. 

This book flows out of the belief that [programming is theory building](). Programming is not a working program, is it not a set of instructions, it is not the source code, the documention nor all of these things combined. Programming is the activity of building a theory about how the program connects to and corresponds with the world. In this view, programming languages are the tools which allow us to build theories.

This view drives the book's approach to each language. The emphasis will not be on any particular program and its details, but the way in which each language enables and inhibits our thoughts. For some, this may make the book seem "impractical", but it is our contention that "theory is practical" and "practice is theoritical". To that end, we seek to strike a balance between rigor and allowing the reader to gain an intuition about the topic at hand.

## Intended Audience

The primary aim of this book is to do what the title says, to introduce people to programming. This means this book is aimed at people with no knowledge of programming. That said, the books hopes to follow in the footsteps *The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programming* (SICP) AKA "the wizard book"[^1]. For anyone not familiar with this book, this means that the focus is on the subject of programming rather than helping a beginner get setup with a programming environment. Books which aim to teach how to setup a development environment, which libraries to use, etc, have their place, but limit themselves in terms of their time of relevance. This book hopes to cover subjects that will be fruitful to beginners for many years to come.

[^1]: We have no false pretensions that this book is be anywhere near as good as SICP.

SICP is not just a book that doesn't cover these sorts of practical manners for its readers, but it also a book of great depth. Many readers have remarked on the books depth and difficulty and we believe the same may be said for the following. This book is not an intended as an easy introduction. Programming certainly can be easy but it requires taken on a certain mindset and practicing particular intellectual virtues. Good programs are created by labor rather than luck. While many today see programming as an easy profession to make lots of money, we see it as a learned skill and a way of thinking.

### Experienced Developers

While the book is aimed at those who have not done any programming before, we hope this book may well be found useful by experienced developers. Because of the large number of languages and concepts the book covers, many developers may be inexperienced with a particular technology and will hopefully find the discussion in those sections enlightening. We would however encourage even experienced developers to consider reading the book from the beginning. The sections in this book are meant to build and much may be missed by reading them out of context. 

### Self Taught Developers

Self taught developers will hopefully find this book particularly useful. In crafting this book, we have shied away, not from the academic world as a whole, but from the academic means of explanation. This means, we will not assume prior knowledge of academic subjects, we omit deep theortical concerns (proofs), and do not dwell on mathematical minutia. That being said, we find the academic world to be ripe with interesting ideas, something to be mined and refined rather than ignored.

## Reading Advice

Often books recommend following some strict plan of study. This often means a recommendation to take notes, reread sections, and to fully complete all exercises. We view that sort of reading as not quite in the spirit of the book. This book aims not to be a textbook, but a spring board for ideas. Don't feel the need to do percisely what the book says, experiment and play. Copying a program line for line is not the goal, but rather taking the program, changing it to see its outcome. Or even better, looking at a program and trying to rewrite it in a completely different style or fashion.

We hope to model this style throughout the book. In fact, the majority of programs in this book you will see multiple times in various languages. This means if you do not fully understand a certian program, you need not fret, hopefully another language will make it more clear.

### Pace

This book is deliberately fast-paced. Often reading a programming text feels like reading math. The style of exposition requires the read to sit and concentrate on each of the details at hand. While these experiences can be educational and sometimes even cathartic, we hope not to duplicate this feeling in this book. Instead, we model this book after works in the tradition of Analytic Philosophy. Analytic Philosophy is marked by its clearity, exactness, depth, and dry humor. Most importantly though, while Analytic Philosophy might not be a best selling novel, it is imminently readable and often a joy to work through.

To put it more exactly, this book is meant to be read without sitting at a computer or a pen and paper. Read the book quickly, pause and think at moments that matter, but for the most part just keep reading. This book is paced so that it may be armchair reading; something to get your mind going.

## Plan of Study

Choosing the order in which to tackle these languages has been rather difficult. There was some temptation early on to simply ignore and create the first "Choose Your Own Adventure" introduction to programming. But better minds pervailed. The order in which a book proceeds uniquely shapes the text, so extra care was taken in organizing these chapters.

We begin and end with LISP. LISP is the perfect language to begin our journey in programming because of its inherent simplicity.
