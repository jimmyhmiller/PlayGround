# Agile Thoughts

Totalizing theories have always had their attraction. There is a certain kind of peace that accompanies the feeling of an end to questions. Well, that’s not quite right, for we cannot help but ask questions. These theories, realizing precisely that, give us not an end to questions, but and end to the search for answers. Limiting questions is cause for rebellion. It is much easier, much more statisfying to instead let the questions flow, but to always draw from the same well to satisfy that thirst.

For what better sensation can there be than to satisfy ones thirst so readily and easily? Why seek water elsewhere when the well is deep and plentiful? Never mind the desert surrounding us. We have the well, what more could we hope for?

### The Desert

This is the barren landscape where the software engineering world has chosen to reside. A world of easy answers, but little joy. A world of simplified values. A world in which all values must pay tribute to the ancient creed of Agile. It is actually quite surprising that we have arrived at this moment, but perhaps inevitable. The software hippie hackers of the early computing revolution gave way to the software consultants of the 90s. Bringing with them all the self-described “anarchist” language of their former culture but with none of its true attributes.

The contemporary software engineering scene is a walking contradiction. The very same “liberating” force for engineers is precisely that which enslaves them. Timo Daum in his [enlightening article ](https://techworkersberlin.com/news/2020-04-01-timo_daum-agile_methods_english/)on the larger dynamics at play regarding collaboration culture and Taylorism puts it this way.

> The Taylorist supervisor, armed with stopwatch and clipboard, has only superficially disappeared in the agile working world - he has been shifted to the inside and has become invisible.

I am not here attempting to justify this characterization. I am sure there are readers who find this quite melodramatic. A complaint grounded not in fact, but in ideology. A complaint lacking evidence, merit, or any real grounds. That fact is perfectly fine with me. I have for a long time thought how to write to those who didn’t see things the way I do and have come up short. To me these facts are plain, but perhaps not essential to what follows. Yet they must be said.

What follows I hope will not rely on this characterization but is perhaps only intelligible from this perspective. For I aim not to modify agile, not to reform it, not even to critique it. But instead to raise doubts to its intelligibility. It seems to me that we have for too long taken it for granted that there is a “there there”. What agile offers us is a pure nothing, a shadow, a twisting wind which can never be caught.

### The Wind

Being caught in the wind is a particularly alarming experience. The feel of a force unseen, the shifts and turns, unannounced. As you begin to get your footing, a gust sweeps in, taking your counterbalance to be in the winds favor. The winds of agile are no kinder than the winds of the unseen coming storm.

The initiation ritual begins as many do, with a founding myth. We begin with a story of the evil monster Waterfall, an all consuming beast. A terror to fear, but a terror conquered long ago. Perhaps this terror was once real. Perhaps the world really did need to be saved from it. For those of us born too late to be heroes, we will never know.

The world is now different after the devastation of the evil beast. We have better ways, we have answers, no longer are we captive. Instead we are free, free to follow the right and noble values laid down before us by our ancestors. Here we are instructed in the ways of righteousness. We are given the values which we must hold dear.

Yet, this is the moment the wind catches us. Invigorated by this freedom, we begin to excerise, only to find the reprimand. “This story was a 8 but you finished in one day!” The exclamation not one of excitement but of frustration. Taking these words at their face value, they are meaningless. But for those who know, this is the moment you begin to see your “freedom” is your captivity.

### The Sand

The wind does not simply keep you on your feet, making you ever aware of the constantly shift buffets you must endure, it kicks up the sand obscuring your vision. As you become adept in the ways of the wind, you find your footing and begin to travel and see. You think you’ve finally understood. You see the true principles of agile with clear eyes. You see a practice of elders not aligned with the principles and so you speak out.

But here the sand obscures, the elders listen with great attention, they contemplate your words. They tell you, you understand the principles well, but lack the interpretation, they point in the distance, read the inscription on the wall, then you will know. You look, all you see is sand. You say, how can I better understand this interpretation? They tell you simply time. The sand falls in hourglass, yet you never reach enlightenment.

### The Heretic

You learn to ignore the sand and the tablets they obscure. Perhaps the elders are right. Perhaps all that can be known can be known through practice, not explanation. You discover the true agile principle, that of adapting to your circumstances, of constantly reflecting, improving, and adapting. You find that your team is struggle with a particular practice and see a better way forward. As you huddle in your sacred circle reflecting on your connection with the divine and how to improve it, you speak up.

What mistake that was. You have not understood well. This practice is not simply for you, but for the good of the whole. For the good of the community beyond the desert. Yes of course it helps the elders as well. But the elders are merely servants. But now you have made it known. You harbor thoughts not conducive to the whole. You do not understand the deep connections underlying everything you do. How could you possibly write good software for the end user if you don’t assign a fibonacci number to an arbitrary chunk of work?

### The Prophet Returns

Your once peaceful tribe has become embroiled in conflict. Your heretical suggestions have taken hold in the minds of your fellow acolytes. Points have become confused. Is Three Eight? Is Eight One? Does Thirteen even exist? But now you hear the great news the prophet is returning! He who is ways in the way of agile will set your paths straight. Surely he will see the confusion of his people. He will speak with the elders and help them see the way.

All gather in the town square as the prophet arrives. The elders proclaim his wisdom and tell you they’ve heard your worries. They know the prophet is much wiser than they are, and will heed his word. The prophet dismisses the elders. Telling them they must go to their chambers and not interfere, the prophet must hear from the people alone. What a marvelous experience it is. The prophet listens careful, extols the wonderful principles of agile in their most surprising form. You find your enthusiasm growing. The prophet hears your pleas and tells you he will plead your case.

Night falls and as you are about to drift off to sleep, you hear distant music. Enticed by the sound, you sneak out to see the elders gathered at a large table, drink and extravagant food overflow in abundance. The prophet sits at the head of the table, flipping a gold coin in between his fingers.

The next day the prophet addresses the crowd. He repeats the concerns all have raised, for he truly understands. He tells you he has answer. That after talking to the elders, they have become enlightened as well. What are we to do to solve our crisis? A rededication of the faith. He takes out his scroll of principles and highlights three he believes we should attend to daily. He extols the elders for their willingness to dedicate themselves to these principles. He assures you that if the community dedicates itself to these principles, all will be healed.

You raise your hand, excited and afraid “Are there any practices you think we should change or get rid of to best live out these principles?” A smile comes across the prophets face. He lets out a small laugh and says “Practice follows from principles, not the other way. Attend to the principles and the practice will follow”.
