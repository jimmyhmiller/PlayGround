# Card Driven Development

Every company I've worked at has practice what I call "Card Driven Development". Card Driven Development (CDD) is an umbrella term meant to encompass quite a few different development processes. The name comes from the use "cards" (digital or physical) found in the Scrum and Kanban processes as a means of organizing work, but CDD extends further than these two processes, encompasses formal or non-formal processes that have a few things in common. In fact, as I see CDD some instances of Scrum and Kanban may in fact not be a CDD process, depsite heavy use of cards.

CDD first is a way of approaching the software development that involves a splitting of responsibilities. In CDD there must be at least two groups, the first, often called "Engineering" is responsible for  technical duties including writing code, maintaining code, and operational concerns like managing servers. The second group, often known as "Product" or informally "the business", is responsible for researching, detailing, and prioritzing what work needs to be done. Product gives work to Engineering, they prioritize what work will be done next, and they message out the status of the work to various interested parties.

This split in responsibility means that the day to day work accomplished by Engineering and Product looks very different. Engineer, when operating well, is about shipping working software to customers, where as product's work is an act of delegation. This can often lead engineers to believe that product does nothing, but this could not be further from the truth. Product's days are packed with work. Product's role involves being pulled in many directions, they must keep track of the work in progress, while continously engaging with the various interested parties vying for their attention; attempting to get their parties particular needs worked on next. Product's work involves status updates, meetings, research, and above all else detailing and prioritizing work for Engineering.

## The Card

This last part is where the Card makes its appearance. The work needed to be done it is too large to write down and detail in its entirety. Even if this task could be achieved, it isn't desirable because by the time it were written down, the facts on the ground may have changed. So a system of dividing work is adopted, in CDD this system is the card.

Cards are a place to describe work that needs to be done and it what order it should be done in. Cards  break work into small chunks, typically focused on functionality that some particular party would like. Cards serve as a meeting point for Product and Engineering. Product writes cards, prioritizes cards, and gives them to Engineering as work that needs to be done. Engineering then works in the order given by product. Sometimes this means taking multiple cards at a time and making a time commitment for their completion (often called a sprint). Other times cards are pulled in one by one as time and resources permit (this process is often referred to as a Kanban-style workflow).

As described here the card making process is entirely owned by Product. In reality, there is usually a collaborative between Product and Engineering around cards. Typically cards are reviewed and discussed before they ever are handed to an Engineer to be worked on. Often times this discussion process may involve creating more cards needed to be completed before the card being discussed can be. Some of these cards may even be "technical cards", cards created an owned by Engineering. With the exception of these technical cards, cards are ultimately owned by Product. Product has the final say in the priority of cards and also serves as the "acceptor" for the fact that the work descibed in cards has in fact been accomplished.

## The Problem with Card Driven Development

The above was meant to serve as a neutral description of what is entailed by CDD. I imagine the process as I describe above will be familar to many reading this. CDD is a process that many companies adopt and do so for good reason. But ultimately I think, despite the best of intentions by companies that adopt CDD, it is ultimately a disastrous process that leads to some of the worst issues plaguing modern software development. My contention is that companies that adopt CCD will inevitably exacerbate these issues, leading to developer dissatisfaction and ultimately decrease productivity.
