# It's Time We Reimagined the Text Editor

The last serious attempt to reimagine the text editor happened [8 years ago](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ibdknox/light-table). There have been [numerous](https://tylr.fun/) [attempts](https://darklang.com/) [to](https://hazel.org/) try and move beyond text. There have been countless new editors released in that time span. And yet none of them try to do anything novel. They are better implementations of what we already have. Faster and less bloated are often the main selling points. I think its time we broke this pattern and start imagining an text editor that moves beyond the basics we've had for the last 30 years.

## A Text Editor For Today

In some ways programming hasn't changed drastically in the last 30 years. But the landscape around it has. We don't ship boxed software anymore. Instead we work on systems with countless metrics, traces, and logs constantly being produced giving us a vast amount of information on our running systems.  We write tests that constantly exercise our code, providing us with feedback on correctness. We work remotely, connecting with our colleagues either over a screen share, or asynchronously. We work on teams, often of many engineers making changes to software we are entirely unaware of. We work with numerous apis whose documentation is either lacking or non-existent. Yet, none of this context has made it into our editor.

Yes, there are some test suite integrations into editors. There are things live share for vscode. But we cannot pretend these exhaust the advantages we could gain if we integrated everything from this modern programming ecoystem we live in. For some reason, we have avoided this, opting for a user-interface conservatism when it comes to our text editors. But why have we chosen to do this? Perhaps it is a slight modification to [Jakob's Law](https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/); our apps should be like others to be famliar. But programmers **spend more time in their editor than any other app**. So why make it as good as it can be? Why not allow ourselves an app that works differently even if we have to learn it?[^1]

### More Than Text

### Collaborative

### Notes

### Integration



[^1]: I mean, we already do this in some ways. How long does it take to learn vim or emacs? They are so vastily different from other software. Let's do that but for a modern editor.
