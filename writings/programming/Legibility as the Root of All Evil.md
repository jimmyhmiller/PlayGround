# Legibility as the Root of All Evil

If you've ever worked in enterprise software, you know that [it is all awful](https://jimmyhmiller.github.io/ugliest-beautiful-codebase). But why is that? It would be easily to attribute it to any number of problems, difficulties of organizing large groups of people, complexity of existing codebases, disconnect between user and purchaser. But none of those are interesting because they all assume some sort of inevitability. They tell us that the structure of the problem is what causes the badness, but from the inside it doesn't feel that way.

Because from the inside, we can see not only that the software sucks, but that there are countless peoiple trying to make it better. Of course, there are those often discussed engineers who phoned it in long ago, but for every one of thise, there two others who desparately want to work on good software. People who have not just the vision, but the grit, and determination to accomplish the task. But nothing ever gets good. 

After years of failing to understand why, I think I've finally laid a finger on it. The processes and practices needed to improve this kind of software are inherently illegible. That is, they involve a way of working that necessarily will only be understandable to the in-group. Because of the complexity of these system, the ways needed to make them better cannot be systematized, they cannot be simply written down as a plan. Importantly, this doesn't mean that these systems can't be fixed. ("This cannot be systemized" is not synonymous with "this does not exist", despite what many programmers believe.) Instead, it simply means that in practice it almost never happens. 

But who cares about practicalities?

## The Small Productive Team

I doubt I can give you any direct, straight-forward argument to the conclusion I've just stated. So won't attempt to. Instead, what I will often is a new lense through which you can see things you already accept. We start with the fact everyone knows, the unreasonable effectivness of small teams.
