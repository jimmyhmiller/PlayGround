# Legibility as the Root of All Evil

Thanks to Sean Goedecke's [Seeing Like a Software Company](https://www.seangoedecke.com/seeing-like-a-software-company/) I can finally finish this draft that has been sitting in my "write a blog post about this" pile for far too long. I never could bring myself to write explaining and defending why companies care so much about legibility. But Sean has done that for me. In what follows I don't assume you have read Sean's post. But you should, it is fantastic.

> By “legible”, I mean work that is predictable, well-estimated, has a paper trail, and doesn’t depend on any contingent factors (like the  availability of specific people). Quarterly planning, OKRs, and Jira all exist to make work legible. Illegible work is everything else: asking for and giving favors, using tacit knowledge that isn’t or can’t be written down, fitting in unscheduled changes, and drawing on interpersonal relationships.

## The Junior Engineer's Run In with Legibility

I have been struggling against legibilty since my first software job. Well that's not entirely accurate, my beef with legibility far predates my understanding of the concept. I didn't get good grades in high school. I did well on tests, took hard classes, but did none of my homework. Looking back in many ways it was a silly decision and one I'd change. But I still can conjure up that feeling I once had. That feeling of injustice. The feeling of wasting my time. I believed strongly that school was supposed to be about learning the material and I knew the material. Why was I wasting my time?

I didn't understand that what I faced then would continue to be a life long struggle. School wasn't (only) about learning the material. It was a system designed to measure outcomes. To make homogenized reports of students abilities. To offer monitoring, control, accountability to bureaucrats, politicians, parents, communties, and administrators. The standardized tests, learning objectives, and later pre and post test structure weren't given based on some belief that this is the best way to educate, but instead for the goal of legibility.

To my surprise, that didn't change much as I made it into the workforce. I remember in my first job I had been moved to a new project. One which was "doing agile properly", what this meant was scrum with story points. I had been asked to estimate 5 stories. I had never seen these stories before. Never built features like this before, so I was entirely unsure. It ended up being something like 3, 5, 3, 5, 5. As it turns out that last 5 was quite different from the rest. It was the general feature that made all the others trivial. So that work that was supposed to take 2+ weeks, took 3 days.

The business was furious.

Sadly this story is not unique to me. I saw the same episode repeated time after time with eager junior engineers. Finishing work early is not a good thing. Predictiability matter more than outcome.

## The Struggle Continues

This focus on predability greatly confused me. I personally like predictablity because it can give me confidence in my outcome. So, I might avoid a highway and take less traveled backroads because I can know what time I wil arrive and have a high confidence I won't be stuck in a traffic jam. But the predictable the business wanted was not quite like that. A team, constantly reporting, demoing, tracking, but making awful software and not finishing on time, was more desirable than one that was invisible, but delivered, on-time, good software. There was nothing in my personal experience that could make sense of this. An efficiency tradeoff is one thing. This is something else.

I eventually came to realize that these business people did not care about the software. This was a suprising fact for me. It seemed that I had been hired to write software. It seemed that our company needed this software to be able to do our business. All these things might be true, but that wasn't what our interactions were about. When I was yelled at for finishing early, it wasn't about the software, it was about me.

### Poltics? Or something else

This feels dense to admit, but I had never considered that me, the person, mattered in this equation at all. We were building software, the software was what matter. But many people are playing a different game. They are looking to impress. They are looking to be promoted. They are looking for more pay, more prestige, more power. Their relationship to me mattered for these goals. The predictiblity these people were looking for was not in the quality of the software they would get. The outcome they wanted was not found in the software, it was found in the people around them. It was found in how others viewed them and I had the ability to effect that.

The lesson here is often given the name politics. We warn junior developers about politics. Tell them their value, their dangers, offer them different paths they can take in their career in how much they get involved in them. But what we don't talk about is the particular shape our politics takes. We don't take about the pressures, the systems that create the particular form of politics in our corporations. We don't examine those negative consequences.
