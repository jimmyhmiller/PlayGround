# Legibility as the Root of All Evil

Thanks to Sean Goedecke's [Seeing Like a Software Company](https://www.seangoedecke.com/seeing-like-a-software-company/) I can finally finish this draft that has been sitting in my "write a blog post about this" pile for far too long. I never could bring myself to write explaining and defending why companies care so much about legibility. But Sean has done that for me. In what follows I don't assume you have read Sean's post. But you should, it is fantastic.

> By “legible”, I mean work that is predictable, well-estimated, has a paper trail, and doesn’t depend on any contingent factors (like the  availability of specific people). Quarterly planning, OKRs, and Jira all exist to make work legible. Illegible work is everything else: asking for and giving favors, using tacit knowledge that isn’t or can’t be written down, fitting in unscheduled changes, and drawing on interpersonal relationships.

## The Junior Engineer's Run In with Legibility

I have been at war with legibilty since my first software job. Well that's not entirely accurate, my beef with legibility far predates my understanding of the concept. I didn't get good grades in high school. I did well on tests, too hard classes, but did none of my homework. Looking back in many ways it was a silly decision and one I'd change. But I still can conjure up that feeling I once had. That feeling of injustice. The feeling of wasting my time. I believed strongly that school was supposed to be about learning the material and I knew the material. Why was I wasting my time?

I didn't understand then that what I faced then would continue to be a life long struggle. School wasn't (only) about learning the material. It was a system designed to measure outcomes. To make homogenized reports of students abilities. To offer monitoring, control, accountability to bureaucrats, politicians, parents, communties, and administrators. The standardized tests, learning objectives, and later pre and post test structure weren't given based on some belief that this is the best way to educate, but instead for that goal of legibility.

To my surprise, that didn't change much as I made it into the workforce. I remember in my first job I had been moved to a new project. One which was "doing agile properly", what this meant was scrum with story pointed. I had been asked to estimate 5 stories. I had never seen these stories before. Never built features like this before, so I was entirely unsure. It ended up bing something like 3, 5, 3, 5, 5. As it turns out that last 5 was quite different from the rest. It was the general feature that made all the others trivial. So that work that was supposed to take 2+ weeks, took 3 days.

The business was furious.

Sadly this story is not unique to me. I saw the same episode repeated time after time with eager junior engineers. Finishing work early was not a good thing. Predictiability matter more than outcome.

## But What About Good Legibility?

There is no doubt that my general distaste for legibility has caused its fair share of conflict with even those coworkers who enjoy working with me.
