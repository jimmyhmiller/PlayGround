# That will never change. Not here.

I remember starting my first job, excited that this hobby I had as a kid could pay so well. 55k, more than double what my parents had ever made. Diving into code written by other people for the first time was exciting. Hundreds of thousands of lines of hastily written code, a lot of C# some VB, every javascript framework that had ever existed, and a sprinkling of Delphi. To me at 20 years old, the whole thing felt like possibilities. So much we could do and change. So much to improve. But quickly I found out:

> **That will never change. Not here.** - Every senior dev I talked to.

This sentiment, perhaps in more words has been a constant staple in the 12 years since that first encounter as a bright-eyed junior developer. These words were not meant to discourage. They were not a rephrimand nor some sort "get off my lawn" routine. They were meant sincerely. They were meant as a lesson; as help so that I didn't grow frustrated. But that didn't work.

## Frustration

I am certain that a lot of people I've worked with (especially in those earlier years) didn't like working with me. I was frustrated in a very vocal way about the lack of progress, about the resignation I felt in those around me. I saw so many opportunties for progress but felt thwarted at every attempt. I saw very few ways to accomplish my goals. I had very little social understanding of the effect my ardent advocacy had on others perception of me. Nor honestly did I care. The world was wrong and I wanted to make it right.

You may expect that I'm here say to I've learned to accept that wisdom, that my elders were right all along. Isn't that how things are supposed to go? But I haven't. When looking back at 20 year me and the frustrations I felt, I still feel them. There were things there we could have easily fixed. There others that may have been a bit harder, but worth it. One day I'll write a bit more about the crazy things I saw at that first job. (e.g. A sql table that had run out of columns) But now is not the time. The question is has anything changed from then till now? If I'm still frustrated, have I learned anything?

## Accepting the Frustration

Telling young me to accept the way things were had the exact opposite of the intended effect. Nothing made my frustration grow stronger than having that more senior person come to me and calmly tell me that they too were once like me. That they were once someone who was always looking for change. That when they were younger, they were excited about new technologies and new techniques. But now, they've learned what really matters. That it is important to accept that established things are the way they are for a reason. That changing them isn't actually going to make things better.

>  **Bullshit.** - Me under my breath after these conversations

Again I can now look back and see that these people meant the best. But I still feel for young me. Perhaps this advice worked for them. Perhaps they truly were once like me and found a better path. But I never found that path. It is not only when I look back at my first job that I feel the frustration, but when I look at my current one as well. In fact, its not only my job that makes me frustrated, but all sorts of things I see in the programming world. Now, if my frustrations were confined to noble things, major injustices, perhaps I'd have no cause for concern. But they aren't.

I find myself frustrated at so many different things in our industry. The way in which we talk about tests. Our creating of false dichotomies like dynamic vs static typing (you can like both). Our acceptence of the current division between "product" and "engineering". The fact that we all decided we like the word "engineer" better than developer. The fact that we think as people get paid more their "scope" needs to change. Of course, I could also list more serious issues in our industry (discrimination of all kinds), but my point is that my frustration extends beyond those noble causes.

There are probably those who are reading this essay right now thinking, "wow, he should really learn to be less frustrated". This essay is not for you. For those of you who are frustrated. Who don't see themselves being less frustrated. Especially for those who are earlier in your career and wondering if you are just doing the wrong thing. I want to offer the opposite advice.

> Those things can change. You can change them. You just have to care enough.



```
I might just end the essay with the above. Leaving my strategy for change to some other post. But I need some editing to make it punchy

## Caring Enough to Change Things

Organizations don’t want to change. People who have done things one way for a very long time aren’t likely to change simply by being convinced that some way is better. This was perhaps my biggest mistake. I believed that if others simply were convinced that things could be better, they’d try to make them better. They won’t. So how do we get people to change? Through constant focus and persistence.

Things will not change on their own. Not for the better. People will finally realize that they have been doing things in a bad way and start to fix it. Instead, as you get more and more people, people will work around the immediate problem and begin to believe that this is the only way things can be. If you want to change that, you must start by solving some of those problems. Is your build system slow? Figure out why. Is there some manual process you have to do that takes forever, automate it. But here’s the key, don’t do that forever, do it just for yourself.

This will feel counterintuitive. Won’t people be happy I have fixed things? No, because they don’t recognize them as broken. What you see as a problem, others see as a fact. But its more than that. Your proposed solution is almost certainly incomplete. Perhaps you sped up the build, but there is one part that others use that you didn’t realize existed. Now when you commit that change, you are forever biasing people against your change. “Last time you tried to speed up the build, you just broken everything. It’s working now, leave it alone”.
