# That will never change. Not here.

I remember starting my first job, excited that this hobby I had as a kid could pay so well. 55k, double what my parents had ever made. Diving into creode written by other people for the first time was exciting. Hundreds of thousands of lines of hastily written code, a lot of C# some VB, every javascript framework that had ever existed, and a sprinkling of Delphi. To me at 20 years old, the whole thing felt like possibilities. So much we could do and change. So much to improve. But quickly I found out:

**That will never change. Not here.**

This sentiment, perhaps in more words has been a constant staple in the 12 years since that first encounter as bright-eyed junior developer. These words were not meant to discourage. They were not a rephrimand nor some sort "get off my lawn" routine. They were meant sincerely. They were meant as a lesson, as help so that I didn't grow frustrated. But that didn't work.

## Frustration

I am certain that a lot of people I've worked with (especially in those earlier years) didn't like working with me. I was frustrated in a very vocal way about the lack of progress, about the resignation. I saw so many opportunties for progress but felt thwarted at every attempt. I saw very few ways to accomplish my goals. I had very little social understanding of the effect my ardent advocacy had on others perception of me. Nor honestly did I care. The world was wrong and I wanted to make it right.
