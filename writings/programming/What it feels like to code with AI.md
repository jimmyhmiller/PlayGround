# What it feels like to "code" with AI

It's hard to tell hype from reality. It's hard to tell cynicism from sober minded analysis. AI has become a lightning rod for hot-takes on boths sides of this spectrum. People declaring that programming is dead and others declaring that AI systems are completely useless. As Steve Klabnik captured so well [in his post](https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-am-disappointed-in-the-ai-discourse/), it seems that people on both sides of this divide are talking past each other in incredibly strange ways.

On the [future of coding](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/), we haven't really talked much about AI. I have written one blog post about how [ChatGPT Doesn't Know Anything](/chatgpt). I'd imagine for some people this is enough to put me in the anti-ai camp. But I've been consistently using AI systems as they have continued to evolve and been incorporating them into my programming practice. They have been useful at times and not in others. But this isn't what I want to focus on. Programming has a [deep importance](https://jimmyhmiller.com/raised) to me. It is my emotional release, my therapy (I also see a real therapist), and one my favorite things to spend my free time doing. Does AI take all that away?

## Creating Vs Creation

There are some people who program as a means to an end. They want an application to exist, they want to create some experience for people. I have never been one of those people. I mostly don't care about the end product of my code. I care about programming itself. I don't know of a great term to divide these two kinds of programmers, so I will make up terms that I'm not entirely happy with. For the people who care about the end product, I will call them **Makers** and for those enjoy the process over the end product I will call **Tinkerers**.

On the surface, it seems that the current brand of AI is perfect the Makers. AI makes it fairly easy to abstract away the process of creation. For some simple apps, this process is almost entirely abstracted away from the code. For example, I created this very simple [online bingo card generator](https://v0-bingo-card-generator-nu.vercel.app/) using v0. The app is incredibly simple and could have been created by anyone with little to no technical knowledge.

I can't say I found this process particularly fun. It was nice in some ways to get this usecase done for myself. Trying to find a bingo generator that wasn't full of bloat and/or ads was taking longer than simply having AI make me one. But does AI need to feel like that?
