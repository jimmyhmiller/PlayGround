# Rewrites and Paradigms

A rewrite is a radical step. But a radical step we all deeply feel as a desire. Regardless of where we fall on the wisdom of attempting such a radical step, as engineers we feel the desire in our bones. There is software that is just so painful to work with, so time consuming to understand, and so brittle to change that we can't help but want to rid ourselves of it. This desire is not merely selfish. We understand the harm this codebase does to our fellow engineers, and by extension our company. We realize the burnout that is being caused by working in such conditions.

Perhaps we are being a bit dramatic. It is afterall just some ugly text in a bunch of files. And yet, these codebases are where we live. We occupy them as much as they occupy our minds. This world we now inhabit is full of strange values, strange concerns, strange opinions. Every corner we turn we find yet another repulsive piece of code, yet another bug just waiting to wake us up in the middle of the night.

We want to abandon this world and start fresh, start over, not merely in some other world, but in a new shiny world created by us, to meet exactly our needs. In this essay I want to this metaphor. Philosopher of Science Thomas Kuhn tells us that as science shifts to a new paradigm, the scientist finds themselves in a new world. Perhaps that is a bit too radical for science, but might it not be the case for our programming world? What if rewrites were so radical because they truly represent a paradigm shift in the Kuhnian sense?

## Theory Building and Kuhnian Paradigms

Writing a program is not an activity of text construction.
