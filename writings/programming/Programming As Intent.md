# Programming as Intent

There is a ton of advice about how to write good code on the internet. This is my attempt to give such advice. In its bits and parts I'm sure it contains nothing novel, but as a whole I hope it interesting. More than anything though I am writing this for me as means to discover a principle by which to live. Brett Victor spelled out this view of life in his incredibly influential talk "Inventing on Principle", yet despite its influence, its central message was lost. There is a path for the technologist to be an activist. This is the path I hope to take, but what my cause exactly is still eludes me, this is part of that self discovery.

## Programming with Intentions and Ends

There is a tension that is hard for me to resolve in how I view programs. First, programs are creations of people. When people write programs they have some intent or other that ultimately they encode into the program. At the same times, programs in some ways have a life of their own. There are good and bad changes to programs. Programs have an end to which aspire. A program can flourish or flounder. It is this tension that is involved in writing good code. The task of the programmer is to once express their intent, but at the same time discover what the program itself ought to be. 

This view of what it means to write a good program stands in stark contrast to many others out there. First, it doesn't lend itself to objective measurement. Measures like cyclomatic complexity or function size have their place, but do not define the sum and total of what is involved in writing good programs. Secondly, this view isn't a presciptive of some structure or other that programs should follow. It doesn't marry itself to any particular paradigm, it could apply just as well to popular and unpopular paradigms, it can apply at all levels of systems, and can even apply to future ways of writing software that don't currently exist. Finally, this view doesn't prescribe a process that the programmer ought to take when writing a program. Views like TDD describe good programs in terms of the process used to create them, my view allows people to follow whatever process works best for them.

## Expressing the Tension

It is really hard to give advice about writing programs without doing any of the above. There is lots of advice that I myself generally follow. I am for example a big fan of small functions. And yet, I think spelling out these sorts of rules or heuristics, gives the wrong view of what it means to write good programs. Programming isn't a mechnical act. Not amount of apply rules to the existing bad code will get you good code. Good code comes from a creative act. It comes from a process that isn't following rules in fact, it isn't even expressible as rules.

Let's narrow our scope for a moment. Imagine you are approach an existing program looking to make a change, but also looking to make the program better. This a program that you did not build. How ought we approach this task? What are some tatics we can take to understand it? In what ways do we change the program? How do evaluate if our changes are any good? These are the sorts of questions I hope to give advice on. These are the questions every programmer has and yet never gets help on.
