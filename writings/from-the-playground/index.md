# From the Playground

A few years ago I decided that I should save all the code I write and make it public. Even if no one ever looked at it or used it, it just seemed pointless to write a bunch of code in my personal time that only lived on my computer or in some private repo. But organizing all of these one off little things I do into their own separate repos seemed like a waste of time, so I created a single monorepo to house them all which I called [Playground](https://github.com/jimmyhmiller/PlayGround). My playground is an absolute mess full of the various things I've played around with over the years. Some of them had a decent amount of work put into them, while others were never even started. Regardless, these are all projects I was interested in at one point in time and all projects that taught me something.

So in this little sub-series, I figured I would go through my playground, pick out a project and talk a little about it. Some posts will be short, some a bit longer. I plan on trying to include pictures of anything with a visual component. In general, my goal is just to describe what I did, what I learned, and what I would want to explore further later. To me these sorts of explorations are times that I enjoy programming most, so while nothing about them is particularly remarkable, I figure they are worth my time to reflect on. Hopefully you find some of them enjoyable yourself.
