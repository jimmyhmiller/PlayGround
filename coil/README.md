# Coil (working name)

A low-level, Lisp-macro language where **calling convention** and **allocation**
are part of the **type system** — assembly-level control over where values live
across calls and where data lives in memory, with higher-level constructs built
up through macros. Backend: **raw LLVM** (inkwell/llvm-sys).

Core bet: a *closure* is not a primitive — it's
`(code-pointer-with-a-convention, environment-with-an-allocation)`. Make the
type system talk about conventions and allocations, and closures, vtables,
coroutines, and FFI trampolines become library code written in macros.
