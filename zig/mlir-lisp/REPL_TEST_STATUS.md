# REPL Test Status

## Summary

✅ **All 6 core tests passing!**

The REPL now has programmatic test infrastructure and all basic functionality is working correctly.

## What's Working ✓

1. **REPL Help Command** - `:help` displays help information
2. **Simple Constant Auto-execution** - Single arithmetic constant operations execute and show "Result: 0"
3. **Function Definitions** - Functions can be defined with multi-line input
4. **:mlir Command** - Displays the compiled MLIR module (in LLVM-lowered form)
5. **Clear Command** - `:clear` clears the module state
6. **Unbalanced Bracket Detection** - All bracket types `(){}[]` are tracked and errors detected

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Multi-line Input Support** - Fixed bracket depth tracking to handle `{}` and `[]` in addition to `()`
   - Previously only tracked parentheses, causing multi-line input with braces/brackets to fail
   - Now properly waits for all bracket types to close before processing input

2. **Memory Management** - Added `alive_values` and `alive_sources` lists to prevent dangling pointers
   - Values and source strings from wrapper functions stay alive throughout REPL session

3. **Auto-execution Wrapper** - Single operations are wrapped in a temporary function and executed
   - Uses Printer → serialize → parse approach (no Operation cloning needed)
   - Automatically cleans up wrapper after execution

## Test Infrastructure

Created two test approaches:

### 1. Shell Script (`test/integration/test_repl_runner.sh`)
Quick executable that tests 6 core features:
```bash
chmod +x test/integration/test_repl_runner.sh
./test/integration/test_repl_runner.sh
```

**Current Results: 6/6 PASSING** ✅
- ✓ help command
- ✓ simple constant auto-execution
- ✓ function definition (multi-line)
- ✓ :mlir command
- ✓ :clear command
- ✓ unbalanced brackets error

### 2. Zig Integration Tests (`test/integration/repl_test.zig`)
- Integrated into `zig build test`
- Spawns REPL process, pipes input, captures output
- Programmatic assertions on expected behavior
- All test input files located in `test/integration/`

## Known Limitations

1. **Return Values** - Auto-executed operations currently return `0` instead of actual operation results
   - This is a TODO comment in `src/repl.zig` at the `createReplExecWrapper` function
   - The operation executes correctly but doesn't propagate its result value

2. **Function Calls** - Cannot auto-execute func.call operations
   - Error: `loc("t])\0A(":1:1): error: expected attribute value`
   - Issue appears to be with how MLIR parses the callee attribute in the wrapper context
   - Function calls work fine in regular modules (non-auto-executed)

3. **Memory Leaks on Parse Errors** - When parsing fails, some Values are not properly cleaned up
   - Shows as error(gpa) messages on exit
   - Doesn't affect functionality but indicates missing error cleanup paths

## Next Steps

To make the REPL fully production-ready:

1. Implement proper return value handling for auto-executed operations
2. Fix func.call auto-execution (or document it as unsupported)
3. Add error cleanup paths to prevent memory leaks on parse failures
4. Consider adding more REPL commands (e.g., `:list` for defined functions, `:type` for value types)
5. Add command history and readline support for better UX
