                relate it to the accounts, parties, relationships, and cards appropriate for the party.
            - If Active, preference should be used when determining actions to take for the party, relationship, etc.
            - If Inactive, then the preference record should be ignored.  This is helpful for retaining values if a
                preference is temporarily inactivated but the current values should be retained for future use.

            Determines if the alert, when sent to the party, is expecting a response back from the party.
            For example, if a party receives an alert that states that their loan is overdue, it could
            ask a question that the user needs to respond to in order to make the payment.  An additional
            example might be if a transaction went through that appears to be fraudulent, the alert could
            expect a response back from the party to allow the posting to occur.
            This field is typically not managed by the party but is set by the system.
