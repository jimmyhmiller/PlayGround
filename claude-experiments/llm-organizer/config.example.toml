# LLM Organizer Configuration Example
# Copy this file to ~/.config/llm-organizer/config.toml and customize

# Examples:
#   - Ollama: "http://localhost:11434/api/generate"
#   - llama.cpp: "http://localhost:8080/completion"
#   - OpenAI-compatible: "https://api.openai.com/v1/completions"

# Optional: Model name if your endpoint supports multiple models
# model = "mistral"
# model = "llama2"
# model = "gpt-4"

# Temperature for text generation (0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = creative)

# Request timeout in seconds

# These directories will be monitored recursively

# This directory will show your organized views

# File extensions to ignore (don't analyze these)

# Recommended: true

[organization]
# Master prompt that defines how files should be organized
# This is sent to the LLM along with file content to determine categories
prompt = """
Organize files intelligently based on their content and purpose.

Categories to use:
- Work: Professional documents, emails, reports, presentations
- Personal: Letters, journals, personal correspondence
- Finance: Invoices, receipts, tax documents, bank statements
- Research: Academic papers, studies, research notes
- Projects: Project-specific documents (organize by project name when clear)
- Reference: Manuals, guides, reference materials
- Media: Photos, videos, creative content

Additional guidelines:
- Extract and preserve important dates (prefer YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Identify key people, organizations, and locations
- Tag technical content with relevant technology keywords
- Note document type (invoice, report, email, etc.)
- Identify language if not English
- Mark sensitive/confidential documents appropriately

# Set to false if you want to manually trigger analysis

# How long to cache LLM responses (in seconds)
# Longer cache = fewer API calls but potentially stale results
