# Removed file imports for testing - they require external files
# import file("alias-x.arr") as A
# import file("provide-provide-x.arr") as PPX

# Test just the include from syntax patterns

# This file demonstrates advanced include from patterns:
# - include from PPX: PX.x end (dotted path in include)
# - include from PPX.PX: x end (dotted module path)
# - include from PPX: module PX end (module keyword)
# - include from PPX: type PX.N end (type with dotted path)
