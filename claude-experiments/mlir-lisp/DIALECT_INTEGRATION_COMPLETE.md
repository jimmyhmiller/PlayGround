# Dialect Integration Complete! 🎉

## What Was Fixed

Previously, the system was **storing** dialect definitions and transform patterns but **not using them**. The ExprCompiler was hardcoded to emit `arith.*` operations.

Now, everything is **fully connected and working**!

## Changes Made

### 1. ExprCompiler Now Uses Registered Dialects

**File: `src/expr_compiler.rs`**

- Added `dialect_registry` parameter to all compilation functions
- Added `compile_dialect_op()` to handle explicit dialect operations like `(calc.add x y)`
- Added `find_dialect_op()` to look up operations from registered dialects
- Operations are now emitted from Lisp-defined dialects instead of being hardcoded

### 2. Pattern Executor Created

**File: `src/pattern_executor.rs`**

- New module to execute PDL patterns on MLIR operations
- Framework in place for pattern matching and rewriting
- Currently shows which patterns would be applied (full execution coming next)

### 3. Working Demo

**File: `examples/working_calc_demo.rs`**

Complete end-to-end demonstration showing:
1. Dialect definition in Lisp
2. Pattern definition in Lisp
3. Program using dialect operations
4. Compilation to MLIR IR

## How to Run

```bash
cargo run --example working_calc_demo
```

## Example Output

### Input Program
```lisp
(calc.add (calc.mul (calc.constant 10) (calc.constant 20)) (calc.constant 30))
```

### Generated MLIR
```mlir
module {
  func.func @compute() -> i32 {
    %0 = "calc.constant"() {value = 10 : i32} : () -> i32
    %1 = "calc.constant"() {value = 20 : i32} : () -> i32
    %2 = "calc.mul"(%0, %1) : (i32, i32) -> i32
    %3 = "calc.constant"() {value = 30 : i32} : () -> i32
    %4 = "calc.add"(%2, %3) : (i32, i32) -> i32
    return %4 : i32
  }
}
```

**Notice**: Operations use `calc.*` from the Lisp-defined dialect! ✨

## What's Working Now

✅ **Dialect Definition** - Define dialects in Lisp using `defirdl-dialect`
✅ **Operation Emission** - Operations are emitted from registered dialects
✅ **Pattern Registration** - Transform patterns stored and accessible
✅ **End-to-End Flow** - Complete pipeline from Lisp → MLIR IR

## What's Next

🔄 **Full Pattern Execution** - Implement the pattern matcher to actually transform operations
🔄 **Lowering Pipeline** - Apply patterns to lower `calc.*` → `arith.*` → `llvm.*`
🔄 **JIT Execution** - Run the transformed code

## Key Achievement

**The dialect definitions are NOW USED, not just stored!**

Before:
- Dialects defined ✓
- Patterns defined ✓
- Everything stored ✓
- But compilation still used hardcoded `arith.*` operations ❌

After:
- Dialects defined ✓
- Patterns defined ✓
- Everything stored ✓
- **Compilation uses Lisp-defined dialect operations** ✅

This is a critical milestone toward true meta-circularity!
