# Transform Dialect Exploration

## What is the Transform Dialect?

The Transform dialect is a meta-dialect in MLIR that allows you to write transformations as MLIR operations themselves. This is powerful because:

1. **Transformations as IR** - Write transformations in MLIR syntax
2. **Composable** - Chain transformations together
3. **Debuggable** - Transformations are inspectable IR
4. **Reusable** - Share transformation libraries

## Our Approach

Instead of creating a full custom dialect (which requires C++ TableGen), we'll:

1. **Use Transform dialect** to write transformations on our generated MLIR
2. **Create transformation patterns** for optimizing our Lisp code
3. **Explore pattern matching** and rewriting with Transform ops

## Example Transformations to Implement

1. **Tail call optimization** - Detect and optimize tail-recursive functions
2. **Constant folding** - Fold constant arithmetic at compile time
3. **Dead code elimination** - Remove unreachable branches
4. **Function inlining** - Inline small functions

## Why This is Cool

- We can write optimizations in a declarative way
- Transformations become first-class IR
- Can inspect and debug the transformation process
- More portable than custom C++ passes
