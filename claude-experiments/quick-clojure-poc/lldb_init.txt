# LLDB initialization for debugging minimal spill test
# Usage: lldb -s lldb_init.txt ./minimal_spill_test

# Set breakpoint at trampoline entry
# The trampoline code starts with "stp x29, x30, [sp, #-16]!"
# We'll break on the execute call instead since we can't break on JIT code directly
breakpoint set -n quick_clojure_poc::trampoline::Trampoline::execute

# Run the program
run

# When we hit the breakpoint, print some info
frame variable
register read x0 x1 x29 x30 sp

# Continue - we'll hit the actual JIT code
continue
