# Pyret Parser Results

## Latest Results (After Grammar Fixes)

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Total Files Tested:** 527
**Success Rate:** 66.6% (351 files)
**Failure Rate:** 33.4% (176 files)

## Improvement Summary

### Before Grammar Fixes
- **Success Rate:** 60.0% (316/527 files)
- **Failed:** 211 files

### After Grammar Fixes
- **Success Rate:** 66.6% (351/527 files)
- **Failed:** 176 files

### What Was Fixed
✅ **Added single-quote string support** (`'hello'`)
✅ **Added triple-backtick multi-line strings** (``` ```hello\nworld``` ```)
✅ **Added block comment support** (`#| nested |# comments`)
✅ **Added proper escape sequence handling** (`\n`, `\t`, `\\`, etc.)

### Impact
- **+35 files** now parse successfully
- **+6.6%** improvement in success rate
- Reduced failures by **16.6%** (from 211 to 176)

## Current State

### Successfully Parsing ✅

The parser now handles:
- Single-quote strings: `'hello'`
- Double-quote strings: `"hello"`
- Multi-line strings: ``` ```hello\nworld``` ```
- Escape sequences: `\n`, `\t`, `\\`, `\"`, `\'`, etc.
- Block comments: `#| comment |#` with nesting support
- Line comments: `# comment`
- Basic functions and data types
- Import/export statements
- Where clauses for testing
- Type annotations (basic)
- Module system (most patterns)

### Still Failing ❌

176 files still fail, primarily due to:

1. **Complex Expression Parsing** (~50-60 files)
   - Deeply nested expressions
   - Some operator precedence issues
   - Expression-level type annotations

2. **Advanced Language Features** (~40-50 files)
   - `doc:` statements in function bodies (not just `doc "string"`)
   - Complex type system features
   - Some cases expressions
   - Table operations edge cases

3. **Object/Data Structure Edge Cases** (~30-40 files)
   - Some mixin patterns
   - Complex object patterns
   - Advanced data definitions

4. **Module System Edge Cases** (~20-30 files)
   - Some import patterns
   - Re-export edge cases
   - Complex provide specifications

5. **Other Issues** (~20 files)
   - Compiler internals with edge cases
   - Advanced runtime features
   - Specific syntax combinations

## Next Steps to Improve

### High Priority (Could add 10-15%)
1. Fix `doc:` statement support (currently only supports `doc "string"`)
2. Improve complex expression parsing
3. Review operator precedence

### Medium Priority (Could add 5-10%)
4. Add missing statement types
5. Handle more object pattern edge cases
6. Fix module system edge cases

### Low Priority (Could add 2-5%)
7. Advanced type system features
8. Compiler-specific syntax
9. Runtime-specific features

## Files for Investigation

To understand remaining failures, examine:
- `/ast-json-simple.arr` - doc: statement issue
- `/examples/loop.arr` - Not actually a loop keyword issue
- `/src/arr/compiler/*.arr` - Complex language features
- `/examples/object-patterns/*.arr` - Object pattern edge cases

## Conclusion

The grammar fixes were highly effective, improving the success rate from **60%** to **66.6%** by adding proper string syntax support and block comments. The parser now has solid coverage of Pyret's core syntax.

The remaining 33.4% of failures are concentrated in:
- Complex/nested expressions
- Advanced language features (`doc:` statements, etc.)
- Edge cases in type system and module system
- Compiler implementation files with unusual syntax

With focused work on expression parsing and the `doc:` statement issue, we could likely reach **75-80%** success rate.
