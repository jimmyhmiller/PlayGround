## Customization

The design system can be easily customized by modifying `DesignSystem.swift`:

```swift
// Colors
static let accent = NSColor(red: 0.3, green: 0.6, blue: 1.0, alpha: 1.0)
static let background = NSColor(red: 0.05, green: 0.05, blue: 0.07, alpha: 1.0)

// Typography
static let title1 = NSFont.systemFont(ofSize: 22, weight: .semibold)

// Spacing
static let lg: CGFloat = 16
```

This creates a cohesive, beautiful experience that feels at home on modern macOS.
