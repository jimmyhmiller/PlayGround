I'm organizing my personal library of programming and computer science materials. I've extracted text from a PDF and need your help classifying it.

Context: I have hundreds of PDFs scattered across my computer - some are valuable programming books, research papers, and technical articles I want to keep organized. Others are personal documents (resumes, invoices, receipts), aviation manuals, advertisements, flyers, and other non-technical materials that shouldn't be in my CS library.

Your task: Determine if this document excerpt is a computer science or programming research paper, technical article, or book that belongs in a programming library.

INCLUDE:
- Research papers about programming, algorithms, software engineering, compilers, type systems
- Technical books about computer science, programming languages, software design
- Academic articles about computation theory, distributed systems, databases
- Technical tutorials and in-depth technical documentation

EXCLUDE:
- Resumes and CVs (even from programmers)
- Invoices, receipts, tax forms, financial documents
- Flight manuals, aviation documents (even though they mention "programming autopilots")
- T-shirt order forms, flyers, advertisements, promotional materials
- Personal correspondence, contracts, legal documents
- General product manuals and user guides
