# Honu Implementation Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

The current implementation is a basic parser with some macro capabilities, but it **fundamentally lacks the core Honu enforestation algorithm**. The project has diverged significantly from the Honu specification described in `docs-claude.md` and instead implements a simplified infix parser with macro support.

## Critical Missing Components

### 1. **Core Enforest Algorithm** ❌ **COMPLETELY MISSING**

**Required (from docs-claude.md):**
- Cooperative `enforest()` function with operator stack and combine functions
- Interleaved parsing and macro expansion during enforestation
- Proper Pratt parsing with precedence-driven parsing decisions
- `EnforestState` with combine functions and precedence tracking
- Recursive enforestation with proper continuation handling

**Current State:**
- Simple infix expression parser (`parse_infix_expression`)
- No operator stack or combine functions
- No proper Pratt parsing implementation
- No interleaved macro expansion during parsing
- Simplified precedence handling that doesn't follow Honu algorithm

**Impact:** This is the fundamental algorithm that makes Honu work. Without it, this is not a Honu implementation.

### 2. **Two-Pass Parsing Architecture** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED BUT WRONG**

**Required:**
- `parse1` discovers bindings *while* enforesting top-level forms  
- `parse2` completes parsing using discovered bindings
- Both passes call back into each other through recursive parsing of nested scopes
- Cooperative, not sequential operation

**Current State:**
- Has `parse1` and `parse2` functions but they're sequential, not cooperative
- `parse1` uses simplified `enforest_infix` instead of proper enforestation
- No recursive callback between passes
- Missing binding discovery during enforestation

### 3. **Delayed Block Parsing** ❌ **MISSING**

**Required:**
- `TreeTerm::Block` should contain unparsed `Vec<Term>` for delayed parsing
- Blocks parsed only when bindings are fully discovered (enabling forward references)
- Proper scope management during delayed parsing

**Current State:**
- Blocks are parsed immediately during enforestation
- No delayed parsing capability
- Forward references cannot work

### 4. **Proper Scope Sets Implementation** ⚠️ **BASIC IMPLEMENTATION**

**Required:**
- Scope sets used for hygiene and binding resolution
- Complex scope subset relationships for binding lookup
- Scope creation and management during parsing phases

**Current State:**
- Basic `ScopeSet` struct exists
- Limited scope management
- No proper hygiene system
- Subset checking exists but not used correctly

### 5. **Macro System Integration** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

**Required:**
- Macros called during enforestation process
- `MacroTransformer` receives `BindingEnv` for context
- Macro expansion interleaved with parsing
- Macros can influence operator precedence and binding discovery

**Current State:**
- Basic macro system exists
- Macros don't receive `BindingEnv` (wrong signature: `fn transform(&self, terms: Vec<Term>)` vs required `fn transform(&self, terms: Vec<Term>, env: &BindingEnv)`)
- Macro expansion happens separately from enforestation
- No macro influence on binding discovery

### 6. **C-Style Syntax Support** ❌ **MISSING**

**Required:**
- Support for C-style syntax like `for`, `while`, `if-else` with proper precedence
- Function definitions with C-style syntax
- Proper handling of statement vs expression contexts

**Current State:**
- Limited keyword-based parsing (`if`, `while`, `cond`)
- No proper C-style syntax parsing
- Statement/expression distinction not properly handled

## Architecture Comparison

### Required Honu Architecture:
```
Input → Reader → Enforest (with macro expansion) → TreeTerm → Complete Parse → AST
         ↓              ↑                                   ↓
    Parse1 discovers bindings while enforesting        Parse2 completes with bindings
                     ↓                                   ↑
                Delayed block parsing enables forward references
```

### Current Architecture:
```
Input → Lexer → Simple Infix Parser → TreeTerm → Complete Parse → AST
                      ↓                               ↓
                 Parse1 (sequential)            Parse2 (sequential)
```

## Specific Implementation Gaps

### Enforester Module (`src/parser/enforester.rs`)
- **Missing:** Core `enforest()` function with proper signature
- **Missing:** Operator stack management
- **Missing:** Combine functions and continuation handling
- **Wrong:** Uses `parse_infix_expression` instead of enforestation
- **Wrong:** Macro expansion happens outside enforestation loop

### Parser Module (`src/parser/mod.rs` and `two_pass.rs`)
- **Wrong:** Sequential parse1/parse2 instead of cooperative
- **Missing:** Binding discovery during enforestation in parse1
- **Missing:** Recursive callback between passes
- **Wrong:** Immediate block parsing instead of delayed

### AST/Term Types (`src/ast/mod.rs`)
- **Mostly Correct:** Term, TreeTerm, AST types match specification
- **Missing:** Some advanced features like proper span handling
- **Missing:** Complete macro transformer interface

### Lexer (`src/lexer/mod.rs`)
- **Correct:** Produces appropriate Term types
- **Issue:** Limited operator recognition
- **Missing:** Some C-style syntax tokenization

### Tests
- **11 out of 14 tests failing** indicates fundamental parsing issues
- **Missing:** Tests for core Honu features (forward references, complex enforestation)

## Required Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Enforest Algorithm (Critical)
1. **Implement proper `enforest()` function** following the exact signature and algorithm from docs-claude.md
2. **Add operator stack management** with `EnforestState`
3. **Implement combine functions** and continuation passing
4. **Replace `parse_infix_expression` with proper enforestation**

### Phase 2: Fix Two-Pass Architecture (Critical)
1. **Make parse1/parse2 cooperative** instead of sequential
2. **Implement binding discovery during enforestation** in parse1
3. **Add recursive callback mechanism** between passes
4. **Fix delayed block parsing** to enable forward references

### Phase 3: Complete Macro Integration (High Priority)
1. **Fix MacroTransformer signature** to include BindingEnv
2. **Integrate macro expansion into enforestation loop**
3. **Enable macro influence on binding discovery**
4. **Implement proper macro hygiene**

### Phase 4: C-Style Syntax Support (Medium Priority)
1. **Add C-style statement parsing**
2. **Implement proper function definition syntax**
3. **Handle statement vs expression contexts**
4. **Add comprehensive operator support**

### Phase 5: Polish and Testing (Low Priority)
1. **Fix all failing tests**
2. **Add comprehensive test coverage**
3. **Improve error handling and recovery**
4. **Performance optimization**

## Complexity Assessment

**Estimated Effort:** This is essentially a complete rewrite. The current implementation represents maybe 15-20% of a true Honu implementation.

**Most Critical Gap:** The enforest algorithm is the heart of Honu. Without it, this is just a simple expression parser with macros, not a Honu implementation.

**Biggest Challenge:** Understanding and correctly implementing the cooperative two-pass parsing with interleaved macro expansion. This requires careful study of the Honu papers and reference implementations.

## Conclusion

The current implementation has the basic scaffolding (types, basic parsing infrastructure) but is missing the core algorithmic components that make Honu unique and powerful. To make this a true Honu implementation:

1. **Priority 1:** Implement the enforest algorithm correctly
2. **Priority 2:** Fix the two-pass architecture to be cooperative  
3. **Priority 3:** Enable delayed block parsing for forward references
4. **Priority 4:** Complete the macro system integration

Without these changes, this remains a toy parser rather than a Honu implementation capable of the sophisticated syntactic extensibility that Honu enables.
